## What is mobile cloud computing, and what are mobile cloud apps?

Mobile cloud computing (MCC) combines the power of cloud services with the ubiquity of mobile devices. It leverages cloud applications, processing, and data storage to overcome the limitations of smartphones and tablets, enhancing their performance and functionality. In other words, mobile cloud computing takes the weight of mobile devices and delegates computational tasks along with data storage to remote data centers.

When a user interacts with a mobile cloud app, the device sends the input data to the cloud for processing. Cloud servers handle the request, process the data, and return the results to the mobile device. This seamless back-and-forth interaction allows mobile devices to perform complex computing tasks without taking too much strain on their limited capacity.

As regards mobile cloud apps, they are simply applications that rely on cloud computing resources to perform their core functions. From a user’s perspective, they work similarly to traditional mobile applications. The difference lies “under the hood.” Unlike native apps, mobile software depends on cloud infrastructure for processing power and storage, thus having a light footprint on the mobile device, as has already been mentioned.

Mobile cloud computing examples and use cases include:

- social media apps, where mobile cloud facilitates seamless sharing and access to large data files like images and videos without overloading mobile hardware;
- entertainment apps with cloud-enabled real-time sharing of information and content, like voting and music streaming apps;
- e-commerce, payment, and banking apps with cloud data storage functionality for efficient provisioning of resources and services, including tailored views of information;
- healthcare apps, enabling healthcare workers to access patient records and receive instant notifications on mobile devices, improving patient care on the go.
