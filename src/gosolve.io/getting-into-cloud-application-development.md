## Types Of Cloud-Based Solutions Available For Enterprises

Getting the hang of cloud-based apps before jumping right in is important twofold. First, being in the know of solutions brings more clarity as to what is possible to achieve before the project is even roughly sketched. Second, to develop cloud apps, you will need a cloud environment to work in. That’s why, there are three acronyms you have to get familiar with.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software-as-a-service is a cloud computing model where software applications are provided over the Internet as a service. Instead of installing and running software on individual user devices or local servers, SaaS allows users to access and use applications directly from a web browser or a thin client (a low-performance desktop optimized to serve just the necessary application). Outsourcing software maintenance to a third-party provider means less hassle for users. This subscription-based approach allows businesses and individuals to use the software on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the flexibility to scale up or down based on their needs.

Cloud software means that users can work from anywhere, which is especially useful for remote teams and employees. It also eliminates the need to purchase and maintain expensive hardware and software, making it a cost-effective solution for businesses of all sizes. What’s more, SaaS providers offer automatic updates to ensure that users always have access to the latest features and security patches. This means that businesses can focus on their core operations instead of worrying about IT management.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides an on-demand platform for developers to create, run, and manage applications over the internet. In this model, the cloud provider offers middleware, libraries, and other tools to enable developers to build, test, and deploy their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

The key difference between SaaS and PaaS is that SaaS provides software to end-users, while PaaS provides a platform for software development and hosting.

PaaS offers scalability, cost-effectiveness, automatic updates, and reduced IT management requirements, which can help organizations streamline their application deployment processes. PaaS is typically used in situations where developers want to quickly create and deploy applications without the overhead of managing the underlying infrastructure themselves.

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources like servers, storage, and networking over the internet. It offers businesses control and flexibility over their infrastructure and is ideal for lifting and shifting existing applications to the cloud.

PaaS is a complete development and deployment platform within the cloud, providing everything IaaS offers and additional tools to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Although developers can focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management, as PaaS takes care of servers, storage, networking, and more, there are benefits to relying on infrastructure services.

IaaS allows businesses to scale computing and storage resources up and down based on demand, which can help them save on hardware costs. The cloud provider manages the underlying physical infrastructure, including servers, racks, power, and cooling, while the customer has complete control over the virtualized infrastructure, including the operating system, middleware, applications, and data.

Aside from easy scalability, IaaS provides benefits such as cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and security, which can help organizations to achieve their goals more efficiently.

## The Cost Of A Cloud-Based Application Development

The cost of developing a cloud application can vary depending on factors such as the application’s complexity, the cloud platform used, and the size of the development team. Cloud providers like Google Cloud offer free credits to new customers to run, test, and deploy workloads, which can help reduce the initial costs of development.

Additionally, cloud development platforms such as Microsoft Azure offer resources and tools to aid in the development process, reducing the need for dedicated infrastructure and resulting in cost savings. Despite the initial investment required for cloud app development, its long-term cost-effectiveness and scalability make it an attractive option for companies, including startups.

With the ability to easily scale resources up and down based on demand, cloud development offers flexibility and agility, enabling faster development cycles and quicker adaptation to market needs.

## Cloud Apps Development: Steps to Follow

Even if your venture/company/startup is optimistic about the idea, you still need a rough guideline of what to do while creating cloud apps.

### Market Analysis

Such initial analysis for cloud application development involves several steps. It begins with identifying the target market and conducting thorough market research to identify opportunities stemming from user needs. To successfully develop an application, it is then important to define its objectives and goals and determine the most suitable cloud infrastructure to use.

### Requirements

Additionally, assessing technical requirements, selecting the appropriate development approach, creating a roadmap, and prioritizing features are all crucial steps in the process. This way, the analysis helps in understanding the bread and butter of the issue and deciding on cloud technology, other resources, and *modus operandi* in the next steps of the process.

### Hiring Cloud App Developers

A plan in mind is one thing, and the crew to make it happen is another. A skilled cloud app developer needs knowledge of cloud systems, programming languages, API design, and object-oriented programming. They should also understand cloud-native architecture principles, such as automation and scalability, and have the ability to automate infrastructure updates for efficient deployment.

To find the right cloud application developer for your job, there are several avenues you can explore. One option is to create a job posting and review proposals from potential developers. You can then shortlist candidates based on their profiles and conduct interviews to assess their skills and expertise.

Another option is to check out job sites, which have listings specifically for cloud application developers. These platforms enable you to upload your job description and screen candidates based on their qualifications and experience.

By leveraging online marketplaces, job sites, and industry-specific resources (like blogs), you can eventually discover your specific process of establishing a cloud software development team. Of course, this process can – and in some cases, it rather – start while the initial research is still going on.

### Tech Research

Once all hands are on board, the development team identifies the requirements for creating the cloud-based app, considering factors such as functionality, scalability, security, and integration needs.

The team scrutinizes the cloud services offered by the provider, comparing virtual machines, databases, storage solutions, networking features, serverless computing, and containers. They assess the services’ capabilities, limitations, and compatibility with the app’s requirements.

It is also essential to consider and adhere to cloud computing best practices during the research phase. The team investigates areas such as security measures, data storage and management, service redundancy, load balancing, disaster recovery, and compliance regulations to ensure the app aligns with these best practices.

The team eventually explores relevant technologies commonly used in cloud-based app development. This includes considering microservices architecture, containers, orchestration platforms, serverless computing, and cloud databases. The goal is to evaluate which technologies best align with the app’s requirements and goals.
