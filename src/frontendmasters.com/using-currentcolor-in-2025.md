Gotta give props to `currentColor`. It‚Äôs a keyword in CSS that is the OG *variable*. It wasn‚Äôt *always* there, but it was relatively usable in browsers by, say, 2010. `currentColor` is a value, that you have control over, that represents something else.

```css
.card {
  color: red;
  border: 3px solid currentColor;
}
```

What do you think the color of that border is gonna be? Not a trick question, it‚Äôs `red` my friend. You don‚Äôt have to type `red` twice. You don‚Äôt have to worry those colors that you‚Äôve so elegantly tied together are going to drift apart. The power of computer programming lives here.

The value `currentColor` resolves to is whatever the `color` value resolves to at the element being effected by the selector. The `color` property cascades, so it could be set three levels up from the current element, or not at all, or whatever. It‚Äôll always be *something.*

::: note p.s.

it can be `currentColor`, `currentcolor`, `CURRENTCOLOR`, `cUrrENtCoLOr` or whatever. CSS is unbothered. Just spel it right.

## Hard Times

Business just isn‚Äôt rolling in thick anymore for `currentColor`. Search a 10 year old codebase and you‚Äôll find a few hits, but these days, custom properties are a far more popular choice. Are you turning your back on an old friend? Yes. Is new friend better? Also yes. Just saying.

```css
.card {
  --mainColor: red;
 
  color: var(--mainColor);
  border: 3px solid var(--mainColor);
}
```

This does the same thing. It‚Äôs an extra line of code, but your fellow computer programmers will all agree that it‚Äôs much more clear and versatile.

---

## Versatile?

Definitely. Custom properties can be just about anything. It‚Äôs almost weird how permissive the value of a custom property can be. But it‚Äôs certainly not just colors. Hopefully obviously: `currentColor` only references color. There is no `currentPadding` or `currentEmotionalState` or anything.

---

## Bugs?

I figured I‚Äôd have [a play (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-codepen"/>`chriscoyier`)](https://codepen.io/editor/chriscoyier/pen/XJWxVpv) for old times sake. While I was doing that, I noticed a few oddities.

```css
body {
  color: orange;
  accent-color: currentColor; /* doesn't work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è */
}
```

That one just doesn‚Äôt work (across the three major browsers I tried). Why? No I‚Äôm asking *you.* lol.

Here‚Äôs another:

```css
body {
  color: rebeccaPurple;
}
button {
  border: 1px solid currentColor;
}
```

That one isn‚Äôt a bug, I suppose, as the trouble is that user agent stylesheets tend to set the `color` of buttons themselves (e.g. `color: buttontext;`), so if you want it to work, you‚Äôll have to set the color explicitly, or force inherit it.

```css
button {
  color: inherit;
  border: 1px solid currentColor;
}
```

I also swore I found an issue with relative color syntax and currentColor, but now that I‚Äôm typing and fact checking I can‚Äôt find it again so I‚Äôll just leave it at that.

---

## But is it still cool though?

I feel like I‚Äôve made the point that it‚Äôs not amazingly useful anymore, but I might also argue that it‚Äôs not a terrible idea when the intentionality matches up just right. For instance, say you‚Äôve got icons where the `fill` should always match the text color. That‚Äôs a fine use case really.

```css
nav {
  color: salmon;

  svg.icon {
    fill: currentColor;
  }
}
```

Another step further, we could pop a little shadow on those icons that is based on that color.

```css
nav {
  color: salmon;

  svg.icon {
    fill: currentColor;
    filter: drop-shadow(
      0 1px 0 oklch(from currentcolor calc(l - 0.25) c h));
  }
}
```

Here‚Äôs a video of that and some other stuff working together. No custom properties here, all `currentColor`:

I have stuck in my memory [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>a Simurai post from 2014](https://simurai.com/blog/2014/05/04/cssconf) where he showed off the power of this as well.
