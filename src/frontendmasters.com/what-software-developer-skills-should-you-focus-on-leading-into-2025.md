## Bone Up on Fundamentals & Go Deep

Putting effort into really nailing your understanding of scope, closures, and the event loop can pay off over and over again throughout your career.

[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/) is famous for a reason. No matter where you are in your journey, having a clear mental model of the most popular language under the hood can help you clear up common misconceptions about how things work, and help you write more performant code. And if you want, you can even dive [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>very, very deeply into JavaScript](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/javascript/) with a series of courses.

[![Will Sentance: Higher Order Functions Example](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-11.49.29%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C596&ssl=1)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/)

### Learn Programming Paradigms: Functional and Object Oriented

JavaScript is a “multi-paradigm” programming language, so learning Object Oriented and Functional Programming paradigms will pay off in getting you to the next level.[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Object Oriented programming](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/object-oriented-js/)is a popular way to structure larger applications. Then add skills to your toolbox from[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>functional programming](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/)such as using map, reduce, filter, pure functions and composition.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-12.03.43%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1024%2C574&ssl=1)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/pure-functions-constants/)

Ultimately, you’ll want to learn when to use concepts from both Functional and Object Oriented paradigms.

### Make Sure You Can TypeScript all the Things

![](https://public.images.stashpad.live/w3fj7hxkfjx4_SpVURTKBpPf)

TypeScript has won for teams, so you might as well get [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>great at TypeScript](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/typescript/)!

---

## Master a Particular Framework

The longer and wider a framework is deployed, the more things like edge cases and performance issues crop up. You should be able to know exactly what your framework of choice helps you with, and where it’s weak points are and how to get around them.

We have a [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>React learning path](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/react/) that dives into all of the idiosyncrasies of the framework. We are starting to do this with [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Next.js as well](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-next-js/).

---

## Design Patterns

Learning to apply common[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>design patterns](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-design-patterns/)in your code will help you write more robust web applications. You’ll also develop a more critical eye for recognizing when frameworks and external libraries are useful, and when[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>you might not need that framework](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vanilla-js-apps/).

---

## Performance & Algorithms

Often times what separates a good engineer from a great engineer is being able to know when to make the right trade offs. This goes for choosing tools, as well as when to invest in [performance](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-perf/). You can even go as far as diving into the [JavaScript Virtual Machine Engine](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-cpu-vm/) itself if you want to understand what makes code [Blazingly Fast](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/blazingly-fast-js/).

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-18-at-12.06.46%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1024%2C577&ssl=1)](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/blazingly-fast-js/speeding-up-web-sockets/)

Knowing how to measure complexity and use the correct[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>algorithms and data structures](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/computer-science/)can lead towards more efficient solutions and better engineering-thinking in general.

---

## Testing, Code Quality, and Tooling

As codebases scale, you need to avoid making regressions when adding new features. You can do that through unit tests, integration, and end-to-end tests using tools like [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-jest"/>Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-playwright"/>Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/stsmall507x507-pad600x600f8f8f8.u2.jpg?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1)

![](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Playwright_Logo-1.svg)

Learn to set up a suite of testing and code quality tools in the [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Enterprise UI Development: Testing & Code Quality](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/enterprise-ui-dev/) course.

## CSS & Design Tools: Figma, Tailwind, and Design Systems

Having basic[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>design skills](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/design-for-developers/)can make you a more desirable and well-rounded engineer.

Then on the CSS front, it’s critical to know [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>CSS Grid](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-grid/). Right here on the Frontend Masters site, we are currently revamping several key interfaces like our video player, and I can tell you CSS Grid has helped us simplify complex layouts on several occasions. If you want to practice your CSS skills, you can do that through [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>CSS Projects](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/css-projects/).

Once you know the fundamental layout techniques, [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>TailwindCSS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/tailwind-css/) is becoming standard since it removes the need for naming elements and styling them in separate steps.

## Accessibility

Understanding [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>accessibility](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-accessibility/)is important to making sure your websites are usable by everyone. One type of accessibility is ensuring the site can be navigated and used by keyboard, which is also helpful for some power users who prefer to work that way.

Bonus if you learn tips for making [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>accessible web apps](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/accessibility-v2/) in your framework of choice.

## Full Stack: Servers, Deployment, and Building APIs

Learning[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Node.js](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/node-js/)and how to build[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>APIs in Node](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/api-design-nodejs-v4/)can help you journey towards [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>full-stack](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/fullstack/) development.

Speaking of “full stack” — it’s becoming a more and more common term that developers self-identify as and that shows up on job descriptions. Frontend Masters, despite our name, has content across the stack from front-end to back. You can learn it all here. If you’re doing any build process, API, or server side work, don’t be afraid to use that term for yourself.

Rust and Go are both seeing big lifts in usage for server-side work. Rust a bit more on the tooling side and Go a bit more on the custom servers side.
