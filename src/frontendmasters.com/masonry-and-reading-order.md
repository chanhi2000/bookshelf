Two months back there was a bit of a hubbub about masonry layout in CSS with [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-webkit"/>Jen at Apple making a case](https://webkit.org/blog/15269/help-us-invent-masonry-layouts-for-css-grid-level-3/) and [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-chrome"/>Rachel at Google agreeing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/masonry) those use cases would be great, but should be based on `display: masonry;` not `display: grid;`.

Then: nothing. Web standards just move at the pace that it moves and that’s usually [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>good slow](https://arc.net/l/quote/ubuyloem). But I admit I’m a little surprised that it’s been radio silence. I think there is a CSS Working Group meeting in Spain this very week though so we’ll see if that ignites anything.

[**My own feedback**](/frontendmasters.com/feedback-on-masonry-layout.md) said [this is partially a conversation about tabbing order](/frontendmasters.com/feedback-on-masonry-layout.md), and it definitely [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>is](https://piccalil.li/blog/masonry-and-tabbing/). So then the bigger question becomes, does this tabbing issue need to be solved *as a part of masonry*? Or can we solve it more broadly? [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Rachel introduces the idea](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2024/05/26/masonry-and-reading-order/) that it *[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>can](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-4/#reading-order-items)* be more broadly solved.

> … my personal hope is that we can land the proposal for`reading-order-items`before we have interoperable masonry, in whatever form it takes.
