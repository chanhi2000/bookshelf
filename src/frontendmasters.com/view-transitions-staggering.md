I love view transitions. When you‚Äôre using view transitions to move *multiple items*, I think staggering them is cool effect and a reasonable ask for doing so succinctly. While I was playing with this recently I learned a lot and a number of different related tech and syntax came up, so I thought I‚Äôd document it. Blogging y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs cool. [**You should.**](/frontendmasters.com/guest-writing-for-boost.md)

## Example

So let‚Äôs say we have a menu kinda thing that can open & close. It‚Äôs just an example, feel free to use your imagination to consider two states of any UI with multiple elements. Here‚Äôs ours:

![Closed](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cdpn.io_pen_debug_GRVvgLR.png?resize=551%2C1024&ssl=1)

![Open](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cdpn.io_pen_debug_GRVvgLR-1.png?resize=551%2C1024&ssl=1)

View Transitions is a great way to handle animating this menu open. I won‚Äôt beat around the bush with a working example. Here‚Äôs that:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="GRVvgLR"
  title="View Transition Staggers with Sass"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

That works in all browsers ([<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>see support](https://caniuse.com/view-transitions)). It animates (with staggering) in Chrome and Safari, and at this time of this writing, just instantly opens and closes in Firefox (which is fine, just less fancy).

---

## Unique View Transition Names

In order to make the view transition work at all, every single item needs a unique `view-transition-name`. Otherwise the items will not animate on their own. If you ever seen a view transition that has a simple fade-out-fade-in, when you were trying to see movement, it‚Äôs probably a problem with unique `view-transition-name`s.

This brings me to my first point. Generating unique `view-transition-name`s is a bit cumbersome. In a ‚Äúreal world‚Äù application, it‚Äôs probably not *that* big of a deal as you‚Äôll likely be using some kind of templating that could add it. Some variation of this:

```html
<div class="card"
     style="view-transition-name: card-<%= card.id %>">

<!-- turns into -->

<div class="card" 
     style="view-transition-name: card-987adf87aodfasd;">
```

But‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt *always* have access to something like that, and even when you do, isn‚Äôt it a bit weird that the only real practical way to apply these is from the HTML and not the CSS? Don‚Äôt love it. In my simple example, I use Pug to create a loop to do it.

```pug
#grid
  - const items = 10;
  - for (let i = 0; i < items; i++)
    div(style=`view-transition-name: item-${i};`)`
```

That Pug code turns into:

```html
<div id="grid">
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-0;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-1;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-2;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-3;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-4;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-5;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-6;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-7;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-8;"></div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-9;"></div>
</div>
```

Jen Simmons [made the point about how odd this is (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`w3c/csswg-drafts`)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8320#issuecomment-2023077559).

This is being improved, I hear. [The CSSWG has resolved to (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`w3c/csswg-drafts`)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8320#issuecomment-2344208387)‚Ä¶

> Add three keywords, one for ID attribute, one for element identity, and one that does fallback between the two.

Which sounds likely we‚Äôll be able to do something like:

```css
#grid {
  > div {
    view-transition-name: auto; 
  }
}
```

This makes me think that it could break in cross-document view transitions, but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it actually will if you use the `id` attribute on elements and the `view-transition-name` ends up being based on that. Should be sweet.

## Customizing the Animation

We‚Äôve got another issue here. It wasn‚Äôt just a Pug loop need to pull of the view transition staggering, it‚Äôs a Sass loop as well. That‚Äôs because in order to control the animation (applying an `animation-delay` which will achieve the staggering), we need to give a pseudo class selector the `view-transition-name`, which are all unique. So‚Ä¶

```css
::view-transition-group(item-0) {
  animation-delay: 0s;
}
::view-transition-group(item-1) {
  animation-delay: 0.01s;
}
::view-transition-group(item-0) {
  animation-delay: 0.02s;
}
/* etc. */
```

That‚Äôs just as cumbersome as the HTML part, except maybe even more-so, as it‚Äôs less and less common we even have a CSS processor like Sass to help. If we do, we can do it like this:

```scss
@for $i from 0 through 9 {
  ::view-transition-group(item-#{$i}) {
    animation-delay: $i * 0.01s;
  }
}
```

### Making Our Own Sibling Indexes with Custom Properties

How much do we need to delay each animation in order to stagger it? Well it should be a different timing, probably increasing slightly for each element.

```plaintext title="outptu"
1st element = 0s delay  
2nd element = 0.01s delay  
3rd element - 0.02s delay  
etc
```

How do we know which element is the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc? Well we could use `:nth-child(1)`, `:nth-child(2)` etc, but that saves us nothing. We still have super repetitive CSS that all but requires a CSS processor to manage.

Since we‚Äôre already applying unique `view-transition-name`s at the HTML level, we could apply the element‚Äôs ‚Äúindex‚Äù at that level too, like:

```pug
#grid
  - const items = 10;
  - for (let i = 0; i < items; i++)
    div(style=`view-transition-name: item-${i}; --sibling-index: ${i};`) #{icons[i]}`
```

Which gets us that index as a custom property:

```html
<div id="grid">
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-0; --sibling-index: 0;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-1; --sibling-index: 1;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-2; --sibling-index: 2;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-3; --sibling-index: 3;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-4; --sibling-index: 4;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-5; --sibling-index: 5;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-6; --sibling-index: 6;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-7; --sibling-index: 7;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-8; --sibling-index: 8;"> </div>
  <div style="view-transition-name: item-9; --sibling-index: 9;"> </div>
</div>
```

### ‚Ä¶ but does that actually help us?

Not really?

It seems like we should be able to use that value *rather* than the CSS processor value, like‚Ä¶

```scss
@for $i from 0 through 9 {
  ::view-transition-group(item-#{$i}) {
    animation-delay: calc(var(--sibling-index) * 0.01s);
  }
}
```

But there are two problems with this:

1. We need the Sass loop anyway for the view transition names
2. It doesn‚Äôt work

Lolz. There is something about the CSS custom property that doesn‚Äôt get applied do the `::view-transition-group` like you would expect it to. Or at least *\*I\** would expect it to. ü§∑

---

## Enter `view-transition-class`

There is a way to target and control the CSS animation of *a selected bunch* of elements at once, without having to apply a `::view-transition-group` to *individual* elements. That‚Äôs like this:

```scss{3}
#grid {
  > div {
    view-transition-class: item;
  }
}
```

Notice that‚Äôs *class* not *name* in the property name. Now we can use that to select all the elements rather than using a loop.

```scss{6-9}
/* Matches a single element with `view-transition-name: item-5` */
::view-transition-group(item-5) {
  animation-delay: 0.05s;
}

/* Matches all elements with `view-transition-class: item` */
::view-transition-group(*.item) {
  animation-delay: 0.05s;
}
```

That `*.` syntax is what makes it use the class instead of the name. That‚Äôs how I understand it at least!

So with this, we‚Äôre *getting closer* to having staggering working without needing a CSS processor:

```scss
::view-transition-group(*.item) {
  animation-delay: calc(var(--sibling-index) * 0.01s);
}
```

Except: that doesn‚Äôt work. It doesn‚Äôt work because `--sibling-index` doesn‚Äôt seem available to the pseudo class selector we‚Äôre using there. I have no idea if that is a bug or not, but it feels like it is to me.

## Real Sibling Index in CSS

We‚Äôre kinda ‚Äúfaking‚Äù sibling index with custom properties here, but we wouldn‚Äôt have to do that forever. The [CSSWG has resolved (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`w3c/csswg-drafts`)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4559#issuecomment-1642880894):

> `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()` to css-values-5 ED

I‚Äôm told Chrome is going to throw engineering at it in Q4 2024, so we should see an implementation soon.

So then mayyyyybe we‚Äôd see this working:

```scss
::view-transition-group(*.item) {
  animation-delay: calc(sibling-index() * 0.01s);
}
```

Now that‚Äôs enabling view transitions staggering beautifully easily, so I‚Äôm going to cross my fingers there.

### Random Stagger

And speaking of newfangled CSS, `random()` should be coming to native CSS at some point somewhat soon as well as I belive that‚Äôs been given the thumbs up. So rather than perfectly even staggering, we could do like‚Ä¶

```scss
::view-transition-group(*.item) {
  animation-delay: calc(random() * 0.01s);
}
```

Faking that with Sass if fun!

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="JjgrNLx"
  title="View Transition Staggers with Sass + Random"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

### Sibling Count is Useful Too

Sometimes you need to know *how many* items there are also, so you can control timing and delays such that, for example, the last animation can end when the first one starts again. Here‚Äôs an example from Stephen Shaw with fakes values as Custom Properties showing how that would be used.

<CodePen
  user="shshaw"
  slug-hash="LYEEKMQ"
  title="sibling-count() and sibling-index() fade example"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

One line above could be written removing the need for custom properties:

```scss
/* before */
animation-delay: calc(2s * (var(--sibling-index) / var(--sibling-count)));

/* after */
animation-delay: calc(2s * (sibling-index() / sibling-count()));
```

## Overflow is a small bummer

I just noticed while working on this particular demo that during a view transition, the elements that are animating are moved to something like a ‚Äútop layer‚Äù in the document, meaning they do not respect the `overflow` of parent elements and whatnot. See example:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="XWveRxx"
  title="View Transition Staggers with Sass Overflow Issue"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

Don‚Äôt love that, but I‚Äôm sure there are huge tradeoffs that I‚Äôm just not aware of. I‚Äôve been told this is actually a desirable trait of view transitions ü§∑.

## p.s. DevTools Can Inspect This Stuff

In Chrome-based browsers, open the Animations tab and slow down the animations way down.

![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-22-at-9.36.15%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1012%2C790&ssl=1)

The mid-animation, you can use that Pause icon to literally stop them. It‚Äôs just easier to see everything when it‚Äôs stopped. Then you‚Äôll see a `:view-transition` element at the top of the DOM and you can drill into it an inspect what‚Äôs going on.
