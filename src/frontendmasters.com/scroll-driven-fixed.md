Scroll-driven animations is a good name. They are… animations… that are… scroll-driven. As you scroll you can make something happen. The most basic kind, where a `@keyframe` is ran 0% to 100% as the element is scrolled 0% to 100% is particularly easy to wrap your mind around.

I also think it’s fun to mess with the expectations of scrolling.

```plaintext
In very light, fun-only, non-crucial ways. Not in ways that would hurt the access of content.
```

Like what if we made an element that definitely scrolled:

```css
.scrolling-element {
  height: 100dvh;
  /* ... make something inside it taller than it is ... */
}
```

But then all the content within it was `position: fixed;` so it didn’t move normally when the element was scrolled.

```css{4}
.scrolling-element {
  height: 100dvh;
  > * {
    position: fixed;
  }
}
```

Instead, we could have the elements react the scroll position however we wanted.

```css{2-3,6-7}
.scrolling-element {
  scroll-timeline-name: --my-scroller;
  scroll-timeline-axis: block;
  > * {
    position: fixed;
    animation: doSomethingCool linear;
    animation-timeline: --my-scroller;
  }
}
@keyframes doSomethingCool {
  100% {
    rotate: 2turn;
  }
}
```

Here’s that basic setup:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="JoPNEjB"
  title="Simple Fixed Spinner"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

<baseline-status featureid="scroll-driven-animations"></baseline-status>
<!-- TODO: add baseline-status -->

I bet you could imagine that this is the same exact trick for a “scroll position indicator” bit of UI. Position that `<div>` as like a 2px tall bar and have the `scaleX` transform go from 0 to 100% and donezo.

I’ll use the same spirit here to have a whole grid of cells use that “scale to zero” animation to reveal a hidden picture.

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="zxOqqpx"
  title="Here's Johnny - Scroll Driven Animations"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

I think that hidden picture thing is fun! I’m imagining a game where you have to guess the picture by scrolling down *as little as possible*. Like “name that tune” only “name that movie still” or whatever.

In this next one I took the idea a bit further and create randomized positions for each of the grid cells to “fly off” to (in SCSS).

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="YPKqqaV"
  title="You Win - Scroll Driven Animations - Different Take"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

I find that extraordinary that that kind of interaction can be done in HTML and CSS these days.
