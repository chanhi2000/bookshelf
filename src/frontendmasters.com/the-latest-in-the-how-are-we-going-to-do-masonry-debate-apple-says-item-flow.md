[**Last we checked in**](/frontendmasters.com/feedback-on-masonry-layout.md) with how the web platform was planning on helping us with “masonry” layout, it was a versus battle between “just use grid” and “make a new layout type”. Now Apple folks have an idea: [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-webkit"/>a new shorthand property called `item-flow`](https://webkit.org/blog/16587/item-flow-part-1-a-new-unified-concept-for-layout/). Nothing is decided here (I don’t think), but it seems very sensible. I like how it has meaning to multiple layout modes, potentially opening up new possibilities instead of masonry alone. They are going to elaborate in a future post, but it sounds like `item-pack: collapse;` is the road to masonry specifically, perhaps across multiple layout modes.

I’ll repoint to my feeling that [**`reading-order` is very related**](/frontendmasters.com/masonry-and-reading-order.md) and also opens possibility in that we can use what we’ve already got in broader ways without negative accessibility implications.
