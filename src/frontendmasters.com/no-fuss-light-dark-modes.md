There was some user feedback this site should have a light mode instead of all-dark-all-the-time. The theme of this site is simple enough that some quick design tweaks is all it took.

But here‚Äôs the thing: it just relies on your system preference.

(Or whatever is controlling what `prefers-color-scheme` is returning in your browser. I use the browser Arc sometimes and it‚Äôs Light/Dark modes override what is set in my System Preferences. It [**can get confusing**](/frontendmasters.com/why-is-this-thing-in-dark-mode.md).)

It‚Äôs more on-trend when offering color modes to offer users a **toggle.** That way users can easily choose between which they prefer without ever leaving your site. And they might have a preference that is the *opposite* of what their overall system preference is. Those are perfectly fair and legitment things.

Those things also complicate the work.

I think it‚Äôs also perfectly fair to make development choices that are purposefully *un*complicated.

In this case, choosing to support light and dark modes *entirely within CSS alone* was the uncomplicated choice.

## The Basics

It really is just this:

```css :collapsed-lines
html {
  --brand-red: oklch(0.67 0.24 27.98);

  --bg: black;
  --text: #ffdbdb;

  --link-color: #4ac6ff;
  --link-color-hover: #9ce0ff;
  --bright-color: white;
  --faded-color: #373232;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  html {
    --bg: white;
    --text: #323232;

    --link-color: #068dcb;
    --link-color-hover: #67cfff;
    --bright-color: black;
    --faded-color: #dedede;
  }
}
```

Then steadfastly use those color variables everywhere any color is set.

The red stays the same across both. Fortunately red is fine with that.

The main point of modes is that *most* of the color should be dominantly dark or dominantly light, which is *mostly* about backgrounds. So the `--bg` background does the work there and the `--text` variable is an accessible color that sits on top of that background.

But it‚Äôs never *quite that easy*. You always need to need a couple of more colors, even on simple sites. So here I‚Äôm setting up variables for links and a couple of variations.

Purposefully simple.

I kinda like approach of just changing same-named `--custom-properties` myself, but there are alternatives. For instance you could use named colors (e.g. `--my-gray-8`) then use the [**now well-supported `light-dark()` function**](/frontendmasters.com/dark-and-light.md) to do something like:

```css
.card {
  background: light-dark(var(--my-gray-4), var(--my-gray-9));
  color: light-dark(var(--my-gray-9), var(--my-gray-1))
}
```

## Why is offering a site-level toggle so challenging?

- The site level choice needs to override any other choice, so it means you can‚Äôt leverage `@media` very cleanly. But you still need to use `@media` for the default if there isn‚Äôt a choice, so you can‚Äôt back away from it entirely.
- You have to persist the choice, otherwise simply refreshing the browser could wipe away the choice, which is pretty weak sauce. Persisting data means at a minimum using `localStorage` or cookies, but you‚Äôd probably want to do better than that.
- The user choice can be different on the site than what their system or browser-level choice might be, so you need to load what that choice is before you render anything. Otherwise you risk [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Flash of inAccurate coloR Theme(FART)](https://css-tricks.com/flash-of-inaccurate-color-theme-fart/) which is incredibly awkward.

I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs still worth doing if you‚Äôre working on a ‚Äúbig‚Äù site where you expect quite a bit of time-on-site from your users. You can also do something like I‚Äôve done above *as a first step* and then move onto a toggle approach.

## The Effect

I swear the change is much smoother than this (no thanks to `transition` or anything, macOS just makes it super smooth somehow). But when I was recording this video it wanted to be a more more abrupt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

This was based on user-feedback, remember? Well one of those users noticed immediately and thanked Marc because it‚Äôs a better experience for them.
