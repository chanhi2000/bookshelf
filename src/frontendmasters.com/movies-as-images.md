Animated GIFs just suck for web performance, so don’t put them on websites. To [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>quote Colin Bendell](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2017/animated-gif-without-the-gif/):

:::

So if you need that same *behavior* of automatically playing silent moving images, we’ve learned to do to use a `<video>` instead:

```html
<video autoplay loop muted inline
  src="https://assets.codepen.io/3/fire-ring.mp4">
</video>
```

That’s… *attribute soup*. But it works. Plus there is a very good chance the `.mp4` is *way* smaller in file size than the GIF would be.

::: note

My vote would be to always include `controls` as another attribute on there. Yes it adds some UI over the image, but that UI allows the user to hit a stop button, which is an accessibility feature and one I use often to stop forever-playing anyway. If you don’t, at least wire up some CSS or JavaScript that stops the playing on click.

:::

Since 2017, Safari has supported this alternate approach:

```html
<img src="https://assets.codepen.io/3/fire-ring.mp4" alt="" />
```

Just an `<img>` tag! No attributes to remember and get right, and it has the exact same behavior. *Except* the fact that there is no way to pause it, which is a bummer.

There are various ways to ship MP4-as-img by falling back to other techniques. When I started writing this and testing things out I was all prepared to try those and be annoyed at non-Safari browsers for not supporting this idea. But I’ve changed my tune. The fact that the `<video>`-based technique works fine across browsers and has a clear path toward pausing the movement makes me feel like MP4-as-img is just a sub-part technique and probably shouldn’t be used at all.
