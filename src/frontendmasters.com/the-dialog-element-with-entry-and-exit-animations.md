Una Kravets blogged the other day that [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>animating entry effects are now supported](https://web.dev/blog/baseline-entry-animations?hl=en#enabling_discrete_animations_with_allow-discrete) in the latest stable version of all major browsers. The *new cool* way to do it, that is. We’ve long had trickery like applying a `@keyframe` animation with a `to` frame that would behave like an “entry effect”, but it was a bit awkward and didn’t work in all situations. Specifically one like using the new and very useful `<dialog>` element.

This bit of code says a lot:

```css
dialog[open] {
  transition: 
    translate 0.7s ease-out, 
    display 0.7s ease-out allow-discrete;

  /* Post-Entry (Normal) State */
  translate: 0 0;

  /* Pre-Entry State */
  @starting-style {
    translate: 0 100vh;
  }
}
```

There are two big things at work there:

1. The `display` property is listed in the transitions, with the keyword `allow-discrete`. The code for it is hidden in User-Agent stylesheets, but when a `<dialog>` moves from close (default) to open, the `display` goes from `none` to `block`. Using this keyword means that the `display` property is changed *after* the animation timing, so animations can actually happen.
2. The `@starting-style` gives us an opportunity to apply styling to the element *just as it’s entering it’s current state*, meaning the transition will happen between the styles declared inside and outside that block.

Golf clap. Everything is awesome.

What Una *didn’t* cover, on purpose surely, was *exit* animations (because they aren’t in “Baseline” yet, meaning not supported across browsers). But they *are* supported in Chrome-n-friends land, so I thought it was worth looking at. To me, they are just as interesting, cool, and useful as the entry kind.

## Both Entry and Exit

The trick isn’t terribly different than the code above, it’s just to have very specific styles for both the open and closed (*i.e.* `:not([open]`) states. Like this:

```css{7} :collapsed-lines
dialog {
  --duration: 0.34s;
  transition: 
    translate var(--duration) ease-in-out, 
    scale var(--duration) ease-in-out, 
    filter var(--duration) ease-in-out, 
    display var(--duration) ease-in-out allow-discrete;

  &[open] {
    /* Post-Entry (Normal) State */
    translate: 0 0;
    scale: 1;
    filter: blur(0);

    /* Pre-Entry State */
    @starting-style {
      translate: 0 8vh;
      scale: 1.15;
      filter: blur(8px);
    }
  }

  /* Exiting State */
  &:not([open]) {
    translate: 0 -8vh;
    scale: 1.15;
    filter: blur(8px);
  }
}
```

Check it out:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="xxoPzEZ"
  title="Dialog Animate In — Fly from Above"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

And a video in case you’re in a browser that doesn’t support it yet:

<VidStack src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/puie9YCG/cleanshot-2024-08-28-at-09.34.50_mp4_hd_1080p.mp4" />

Note that not only does it *have* entry and exit animations, but those states are *different* — which is very cool! Emphasizing that, here’s one where I move the dialog along an `offset-path` so the exit is really a continuation of the path:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="rNErmmz"
  title="Dialog Entry and Exit along a Path"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

## Usage with Popovers

This isn’t exclusively for dialogs, you can make it work with whatever. But naturally open-closable things make the most sense. Like native popovers! Nils Riedemann has a nice demo here:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="jOjLjYw"
  title="Popover and Backdrop with Enter and Leave Transition using only CSS"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>
