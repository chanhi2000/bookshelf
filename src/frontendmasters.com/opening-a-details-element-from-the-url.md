Say you‚Äôve got a page with a bunch of `<details>` elements on it.

Your goal is to be able to send someone to that page with *one particular details element open.*

I was doing just this recently, and my first thought was to do it server-side. If the URL was like `website.com/#faq-1` I‚Äôd see if `faq-1` matches an ID of the details element and I‚Äôd put the open attribute on it like `<details id="faq-1" open>`. But no, you don‚Äôt get to have the `#hash` as part of the URL server side (for whatever reason ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

Then I started writing JavaScript to do it, where you definitely can access the hash (`window.location.hash`). I‚Äôd just `querySelector` for the hash and if I found a matching details element, I‚Äôd open it up.

Then I was reminded you don‚Äôt need to do this at all. What you need is (drumroll)‚Ä¶ HTML.

The trick is hash-linking to an element *inside* the `<details>`. So like:

```html
<details>
  <summary>What was Rosebud in Citizen Kane?</summary>
  <div id="faq-1">A sled.</div>
</details>
```

Now, if you hash-link to `#faq-1`, the browser will know that it *has* to open that `<details>` in order for it to be seen, so it does. You don‚Äôt normally *need* a `<div>` wrapper or anything inside the `details` element, but we‚Äôre doing it here as it‚Äôs obviously handy.

Here‚Äôs a demo of a page that is set up in this way:

<CodePen
  link="https://codepen.io/editor/team/CodePenTemplates/pen/0198e89f-8650-7d35-8384-959dbdbaf2e1"
  title="Open Details upon Hash Linktitle"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

It‚Äôs probably more interesting to just [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>visit this hash-link URL](https://es-d-4410775920250828-0198e89f-8650-7d35-8384-959dbdbaf2e1.codepen.dev/#faq-13-content) and see it open right up and work.

This came up for me while working on [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-codepen"/>this documentation page](https://blog.codepen.io/docs/pens/blocks/all-blocks/#babel-details-default-config-code) where I wanted to be able to link to specific things that were otherwise ‚Äúburied‚Äù in details elements.

As a bit of an enhancement, you might want to consider CSS like this:

```css
:target {
  background: yellow;
  scroll-margin-block-start: 4rem;
}
```

That will apply some styling to the element that matches the hash in the URL, as well as push it away from the top edge of the browser window a little bit. In this case, it helps make sure the FAQ question is actually visible, not just the answer.
