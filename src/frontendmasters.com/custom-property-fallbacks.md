Look at this CSS and take a guess what color our text will be. No tricks, this is the only relevant code:

```css
:root {
  --color: green;
  --color: notacolor;
  color: red;
  color: var(--color, blue);
}
```

Perhaps surprisingly, the answer is the default text color, usually black. Let‚Äôs figure out why that‚Äôs the case and how to write a fallback that works.

---

## `var()` Fallbacks

The value `blue` seems a likely candidate to be our color, doesn‚Äôt it? After all, we often call the 2nd parameter of `var()` its ‚Äúfallback‚Äù value. However, this type of fallback is only used in the following circumstances:

- The custom property isn‚Äôt defined.
- The custom property‚Äôs value is the `initial` keyword.
- The custom property is [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-w3c"/>animation-tainted](https://w3.org/TR/css-variables/#animation-tainted) and is used in an animation property.

*and*‚Ä¶

- The custom property isn‚Äôt registered with `@property`.

Since a registered custom property *must* be given an initial value, it‚Äôll always have a valid value and will *never* use its fallback.

Our custom property is defined, not animated tainted, and its value isn‚Äôt a keyword, so we can throw away `blue` and keep looking.

---

## Fallback Declarations

Usually in CSS, we can rely on the cascade to fallback to a previous valid value, leading to a common pattern where we declare the property twice:

```css
overflow: hidden;
overflow: clip;
```

Browsers that don‚Äôt support the `clip` keyword will discard the entire declaration and use `hidden` instead.

Unfortunately, custom properties don‚Äôt work like this.

When parsing a custom property or its matching `var()` function, the browser doesn‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs valid until it comes time to compute its value. So instead they are treated as *always* valid, and any previous declarations get discarded.

::: note

If you want to prevent a custom property from being overwritten, you‚Äôll have to [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>mark it as important](https://css-tricks.com/the-surprising-behavior-of-important-in-css-custom-property-values/).

:::

That means `--color: green;` gets discarded immediately upon discovering `--color: notacolor;`, and `color: red;` is discarded when we get to `color: var(--notacolor, blue);`.

In the end, our CSS computes to:

```css
color: notacolor;
```

Unsurprisingly, this isn‚Äôt valid, and that‚Äôs why we get black as our color.

## What We Can Do Instead

That all sounds bad but we actually have several options for writing fallbacks that work.

### `@property`

As mentioned before, if a registered custom property is invalid, it‚Äôll always use its initial-value, which means we can use that as our fallback:

```css
@property --color {
  syntax: '<color>';
  inherits: true;
  initial-value: purple;
}

:root {
  --color: notacolor;
  color: var(--color); 
}
```

Exactly what we want, though:

- We can only define a single fallback for the entire document (which can be good enough depending on how your custom properties are organised).
- The intent isn‚Äôt very obvious, registering a property is a roundabout way of setting a fallback.

If that‚Äôs not a problem for you and/or you‚Äôre registering your properties anyway, this is a great option.

### `@supports`

Using `@supports` lets us check our value is valid before declaring it and that gives us even more flexibility in how we define our fallbacks. Let‚Äôs look at two ways to use it:

Set a safe value first, and then inside an `@supports` block we can redeclare the property:

```scss
:root {
  --color: red;
}

@supports (color: notacolor) {
  :root {
    --color: notacolor;
  }
}
```

Then we can just use it anywhere we like, without having to think about the fallback:

```css
p {
  color: var(--color);
}
```

We can set it and forget it, confident that when our value isn‚Äôt supported we‚Äôll still have our previous declaration to fall back on. 9 out of 10 times this is what I reach for.

Alternatively, let‚Äôs skip setting a safe value, and only define the property inside `@supports`:

```css
@supports (color: notacolor) {
  :root {
    --color: notacolor;
  }
}
```

Where‚Äôs our fallback? Well, since our property only gets declared when it‚Äôs supported, we can use the 2nd parameter of `var()` to write our fallback inline:

```css
p {
  color: var(--color, red);
}
```

If you find yourself wanting to use different fallbacks for the same custom property, this could be a better option.

---

## The Future

Eventually, we‚Äôll have even more options for dealing with invalid values.

New CSS goodies like like the keyword `revert-rule` and the `first-valid()` function will let us do away with `@supports` and write our fallbacks wherever we want:

```css
:root {
  /* Multiple inline fallbacks when declaring the property */
  --color: first-valid(notacolor, maybeacolor, red);
}

p {
  /* Fallback to a different rule when using the variable */
  color: first-valid(var(--color), revert-rule);
}
```

You can follow their progress on GitHub:

- [Discussion (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`w3c/csswg-drafts`)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10443) resulting in the `revert-rule` keyword resolution.
- [Discussion (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`w3c/csswg-drafts`)](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5055) resulting in `first-valid()` resolution.
