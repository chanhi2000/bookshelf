The other day I needed to quickly see pixel dimensions that were *exactly* in a 9 / 16 aspect ratio. Like: 180 / 320. That’s perfectly in that ratio. You might be able to think of that one in your head, but how about 351 / 624? That’s harder to think of. And I wanted to visualize it somehow, so I ended up making a web component (`<aspect-ratio-machine>`) that would display a resizable box in that exact aspect ratio (thanks to CSS’ `aspect-ratio`) then also display the pixel dimensions as well.

That’s [**a light-DOM-only web component**](/frontendmasters.com/light-dom-only.md) that just “enhances” otherwise normal HTML. Perhaps it’s not bursting with usefulness, but it was useful to me.

The reason it was useful, by the way, is that I was playing around with YouTube Shorts, and the thing I was using to upload was *very* strict that the video was *exactly* 9 / 16 ratio. I wanted to record somewhat arbitrary sections of my screen, then crop and arrange and stuff later into a size that accommodated 9 / 16, and I had to type in the pixel dimensions manually in the particular software I was using to get there.

I also needed integers. A failing of my first example above is that the resizer was happy to do sub-pixel values, which were not useful to me as the software I was using to make a video canvas size did not accept them.

I also realized that actually seeing a box in the 9 / 16 size wasn’t particularly useful. I know what a rectangle looks like. So instead a built a more simple solution with a range slider that updated numbers on the screen.

Niche problem; niche solution. But hey I like building little tools for myself so I thought I’d share. [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>“Home Cooked Apps”](https://shoptalkshow.com/609/) as it were.
