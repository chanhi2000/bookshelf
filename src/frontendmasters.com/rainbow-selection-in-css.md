There is a `::selection` pseudo class selector in CSS that allows you to style what content (mostly: text) looks like when itâ€™s selected.

Say your website has pretty strong orange-colored branding, you could use this to extend the feel of that branding.

![Geoff Grahams website with the first few words of a paragraph selected. The selected text has an orange background color, just like the border of the whole site.](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-14-at-7.30.26%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C387&ssl=1)

```css
html {
  --brandColor: orange;
}
::selection {
  background-color: var(--brandColor);
}
```

There is really only a couple of things you can set on `::selection` (see the <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-firefox"/>[allowable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::selection#allowable_properties) bit on MDN), which makes sense. You wouldnâ€™t want to be changing `font-size` on selection or anything like that as it would get messy quickly.

I was on the [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Lit documentation](https://lit.dev/docs/) site the other day and highlighted some text and saw this:

![Lit documentation site with 5 paragraphs of text selected, each with slightly different hues of greens and blues as backgrounds.](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/lit.png?resize=1024%2C895&ssl=1)

At first I wasnâ€™t even sure if it was intentional, but I sure thought it was neat! I figured it was just `:nth-child()` trickery where you hang `::selection` off the end of it. Like:

```css
:nth-child(5n)::selection {
  background: oklch(70% 0.111 0 / 72.27%)
}
:nth-child(5n+1)::selection {
  background: oklch(70% 0.111 40 / 72.27%)
}
:nth-child(5n+2)::selection {
  background: oklch(70% 0.111 80 / 72.27%)
}
:nth-child(5n+3)::selection {
  background: oklch(70% 0.111 120 / 72.27%)
}
:nth-child(5n+4)::selection {
  background: oklch(70% 0.111 160 / 72.27%)
}
```

So I made a demo of that and it works great:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="qEWeWLP"
  title="Rainbow Selection"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

![No dice on iOS But it seems to work everywhere else.](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-14-at-7.54.12â€¯AM.png)

I did ultimately poke at the Lit site with DevTools and saw their approach was basically what I thought it was going to be. Except a little more fancy as they are using `color-mix()` with their primary colors and setting both the `color` and `background`.

If youâ€™re thinking _why not go **full** rainbow_ like with a `linear-gradient()` like any sane thinking person is of course, unfortunately gradients are `background-image`s, which are ignored here, with only `background-color` being supported. ðŸ˜­ðŸŒˆ
