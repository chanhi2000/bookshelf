The Chrome Dev Team recaps the new CSS features that shipped in Google Chrome this past year in one amazingly designed webpage. They cover new functionality for creating more [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-chrome"/>customizable components](https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/#customizable-components), [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-chrome"/>next-gen interactions](https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/#next-gen-interactions), and [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-chrome"/>optimizing ergonomics](https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/#optimized-ergonomics).

<VidStack src="youtube/rnT1XBZWHMk" />

We’ve been tracking many of these features as well:

- The [**Interest Invoker API**](/css-tricks.com/a-first-look-at-the-interest-invoker-api-for-hover-triggered-popovers.md) and [**Invoker Commands**](/css-tricks.com/invoker-commands-additional-ways-to-work-with-dialog-popover-and-more.md) enable us to work with dialog and popover elements directly in our markup without having to reach for JavaScript.
- We are able to tell more interesting stories using [**scroll state queries**](/css-tricks.com/scrollytelling-on-steroids-with-scroll-state-queries.md).
- Juan has been [**looking forward**](/css-tricks.com/how-to-wait-for-the-sibling-count-and-sibling-index-functions.md) to the [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>`sibling-count()`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-count/) and [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>`sibling-index()`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/sibling-index/)` functions, both of which have been implemented.
- The [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>`attr()`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/a/attr/) CSS function was enhanced, it actually does what you’d expect now!
- We have a new way to [**conditionally adjust properties**](/css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals.md) using the `if()` function.
- Designing interesting looking elements is a bit easier now thanks to [**`shape()` commands**](/css-tricks.com/css-shape-commands.md).
- Similarly, we have a lot more control over element corners with [**`corner-shape()`**](/css-tricks.com/what-can-we-actually-do-with-corner-shape.md), not just `border-radius` anymore.
- And If all these new functions weren’t enough, we are able to create our own [**custom CSS functions**](/css-tricks.com/functions-in-css.md)!

This is just scratching the surface though, check out the full CSS Wrapped 2025 to see what all made it into the Chrome browser in 2025. It’s been a wild year for CSS and the CSS Wrapped 2025 page itself demonstrates that in spades.
