The problem: you click a jump link like `<a href="#header-3">Jump</a>` which links to something like `<h3 id="header-3">Header</h3>`. That’s totally fine, until you have a `position: fixed;` header at the top of the page obscuring the header you’re trying to link to!

Fixed headers have a nasty habit of hiding the element you’re trying to link to.

There used to be [**all kinds of wild hacks**](/css-tricks.com/hash-tag-links-padding.md) to get around this problem. In fact, in the design of CSS-Tricks as I write, I was like, “*Screw it, I’ll just have a big generous `padding-top` on my in-article headers because I don’t mind that look anyway.”*

But there is actually a really straightforward way of handling this in CSS now.

```css
h3 {
  scroll-margin-top: 5rem; /* whatever is a nice number that gets you past the header */
}
```

[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>We have an Almanac article on it](http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/scroll-margin/), which includes browser support, which is essentially everywhere. It’s often talked about in conjunction with [**scroll snapping**](/css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping.md), but I find this use case even more practical.

Here’s a simple demo:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="GRJpopp"
  title="scroll-margin-top and fixed headers"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

In a related vein, that weird (but cool) “text fragments” link that Chrome shipped takes you to [the middle of the page (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"/>`chriscoyier`)](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1225199469446090752) instead, which I think is nice.
