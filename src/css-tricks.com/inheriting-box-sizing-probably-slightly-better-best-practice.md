I’m a big fan of resetting [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>box-sizing](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-sizing/) to border-box, so much that we have [**a special day of the year**](/css-tricks.com/international-box-sizing-awareness-day.md) around here. But there is a little adjustment to setting it that seems like a pretty good idea.

Here’s the adjusted version:

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
*, *:before, *:after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

Credit on the inheritence idea to Jon Neal [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/box-sizing-secret-simple-css-layouts#comment-50223), who says:

> This will give you the same result, and make it easier to change the box-sizing in plugins or other components that leverage other behavior.

:::

Explaining further, let’s say you have a component that was just designed to work with the default `content-box` `box-sizing`. You just wanted to use it and not mess with it.

```css
.component {
  /* designed to work in default box-sizing */
  /* in your page, you could reset it to normal */
  box-sizing: content-box;
}
```

The trouble is, this doesn’t actually reset the entire component. Perhaps there is a `<header>` inside that component that expects to be in a `content-box` world. If this selector is in your CSS, in “the old way” of doing a `box-sizing` reset…

```css
/* This selector is in most "old way" box-sizing resets */
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Then that header isn’t `content-box` as you might expect, it’s `border-box`. Like:

```html
<div class="component"> <!-- I'm content-box -->
  <header> <!-- I'm border-box still -->
  </header>
</div>
```

In order to make that reset easier and more intuitive, you can use the inheriting snippet up at the top there, and the inheriting will be preserved.

It works:

<CodePen
  user="chriscoyier"
  slug-hash="NWXWPz"
  title="Easy to Reset Box-Sizing"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

This isn’t a majorly huge thing. You might already be using the `box-sizing` reset the “old way” and never have gotten bit by it. That’s the case for me. But as long as we’re promoting a “best practice” style snippet, we might as well hone it to be the best it can be.
