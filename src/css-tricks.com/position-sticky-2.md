Better `position: sticky;` support is [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-caniuse"/>on the horizon](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky). WebKit dropped in 2013, Firefox in 2014, and now Blink in (probably) 2016. [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-firefox"/>MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Sticky_positioning) explains it well:

::: info MDN (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-firefox"/><code>developer.mozilla.org</code>)

> Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

<SiteInfo
  name="position - CSS | MDN"
  desc="The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left physical properties and the inset-block-start, inset-block-end, inset-inline-start, and inset-inline-end flow-relative logical properties can be used to determine the final location of positioned elements."

:::

Šime Vidas pointed this out in a recent [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Open Web Platform Daily Digest](https://webplatformdaily.org/), and ported over the demo from MDN, which demonstrates the usefulness nicely:

<CodePen
  user="simevidas"
  slug-hash="JbdJRZ"
  title="Sticky positioning"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

As you can see in that demo, it’s a decent candidate for progressive enhancement, as if you don’t see the sticky header feature, it’s no big deal.
