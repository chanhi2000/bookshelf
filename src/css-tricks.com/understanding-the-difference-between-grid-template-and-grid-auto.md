> Within a grid container, there are grid cells. Any cell positioned and sized using the `grid-template-*` properties forms part of the explicit grid. Any grid cell that is not positioned/sized using this property forms part of the implicit grid instead.

:::

Understanding explicit grids and implicit grids is powerful. This is my quicky take:

- **Explicit:** you define a grid and place items exactly where you want them to go.
- **Implicit:** you define a grid and let items fall into it as they can.

Grids can be both!
