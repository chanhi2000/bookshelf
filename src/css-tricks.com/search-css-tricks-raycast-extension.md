I have to search for articles often on this site. And I’d say searching this site is Pretty OK™ in general. Making content searchable on a site with 18+ years of published content is gonna be challenging no matter what, and [**the Jetpack Search tool we use**](/css-tricks.com/jetpack-instant-search.md) is darned good considering it’s a drop-in solution.

At the same time, it’s a bit heavy-handed when all I really need is a quick URL I can copy-paste into some other article I’m working on. What would be cool is a search straight from my local machine which is totally possible by fetching the content from the WordPress REST API that runs under the hood of this site.

That’s exactly what [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Jelte Lagendijk](https://raycast.com/j3lte) built for Raycast, a “shortcut-all the-things” app for macOS and Windows. It’s a [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>little extension](https://raycast.com/j3lte/css-tricks) where you simply type and a get a solid set of real-time results.

Click any item and get the high-level summary with a path to open it up in the browser.
