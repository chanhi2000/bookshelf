2026 is almost upon us. I know we’re all itching to see the clock strike midnight (cue The Final Countdown by Europe), but not without recapping the best CSS-related things that happened over the last two weeks!

## Conditional view transitions

[<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) showed us [**how to trigger different view transitions based on the URL**](/frontendmasters.com/different-page-transitions-for-different-circumstances.md) (or any conditional JavaScript logic, really). However, Bramus mentioned in the comments that [**navigation matching is coming to CSS**](/frontendmasters.com/different-page-transitions-for-different-circumstances.md), so we might not need to rely on JavaScript for that part for very long. I’m keeping my fingers crossed for 2026!

## Annotating design system components for accessibility

Geri Reid carefully explained [how to annotate design system components for accessibility](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-annotate-design-system-components-for-accessibility/), giving solid HTML-based examples. I especially love the part about defining elements, ARIA, markup, keyboard navigation, zoom, and user preferences as accessibility tokens.

## Firefox to become a “modern AI browser” to the delight of absolutely no one

Firefox has been a bit of a rollercoaster lately. It started with [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>an interview on The Verge](https://theverge.com/tech/845216/mozilla-ceo-anthony-enzor-demeo), where new CEO Anthony Enzor-DeMeo said that Firefox “will evolve into a modern AI browser.” With only 2.3% of the [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>browser market share](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share), I suppose it was inevitable that Firefox would try to shake things up, but users don’t appear to want this at all. To stem the bleeding though, [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>they’ve announced an AI kill switch](https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/outcry-firefox-promises-kill-switch-ai-features).

And that’s how I met your Mo- …[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Waterfox](https://waterfox.com/), which is a no-AI fork of Firefox.

## Creating ‘toon text with CSS and SVG

[<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>Andy Clarke](https://css-tricks.com/author/andyclarke/) demonstrated [**how to create the text effects of classic ‘toons using CSS and SVG**](/smashingmagazine.com/smashing-animations-part-7-recreating-toon-text-css-svg.md). I hadn’t heard of the [`paint-order`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/paint-order/) CSS property before this, so that part is pretty darn cool.

## 6 CSS features that you should learn in…*2025*

That’s right, 2025! Adam Argyle wrote about the [**CSS features that you should learn in 2025**](https://nerdy.dev/6-css-snippets-every-front-end-developer-should-know-in-2025) at the beginning of the year. Well, it’s almost 2026 now, so how did you do? I’ll be honest — I barely even touched the surface of [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>`@property`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/p/property/).

## Great CSS posts on Bluesky

Let’s be honest, social media isn’t a fun place to hang out anymore, but I’ll make the exception for Bluesky. I rarely see stuff that’s not relevant to my interests, I actually talk to people on there, there’s a large dev community on there, and of course [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-bluesky"/>CSS-Tricks is on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/css-tricks.bsky.social) too, as is the CSS-Tricks team and [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-bluesky"/>many of our authors](https://bsky.app/profile/css-tricks.bsky.social/lists/3l7w74iflfa22).

So since browser updates typically ship at the beginning of the month, here are some cool posts by the Bluesky CSS community instead:

[<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>Temani Afif](https://css-tricks.com/author/afiftemani/) demonstrated [a very interesting combination (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-codepen"/>`t_afif`)](https://codepen.io/t_afif/pen/dPMBMBE) of [**anchor positioning**](/css-tricks.com/css-anchor-positioning-guide.md), [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>`attr()`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/a/attr/), [container queries](https://css-tricks.com/css-container-queries/), and [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>`shape()`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/shape/), which you can play around with (probably requires Chrome):

<CodePen
  user="anon"
  slug-hash="dPMBMBE"
  title="Connected Circles with Anchor Positioning"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="dark"/>

Stephen Margheim listed the various reasons [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-bluesky"/>why you should namespace your semantic classes](https://bsky.app/profile/fractaledmind.bsky.social/post/3masmuiptaa2l) (e.g., rename `.btn` to `.ui-button`):

Similar to Andy Clarke’s ‘toon text explorations, Ana Tudor’s [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-bluesky"/>displacement map text effects](https://bsky.app/profile/anatudor.bsky.social/post/3mav7kg334c25) are rather astonishing as well, although you’ll most likely need Chrome for cutting-edge stuff like this:

<CodePen
  user="anon"
  slug-hash="WNqvdmN"
  title="No text splitting rotation + extrusion"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="dark"/>

<CodePen
  user="anon"
  slug-hash="JjqXjyJ"
  title="Here is real magic - no text duplication or splitting (hover, no Firefox)"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="dark"/>

<CodePen
  user="anon"
  slug-hash="NWmBmrZ"
  title="Double bubble - no JS on scroll distortion"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="dark"/>

<CodePen
  user="anon"
  slug-hash="MWxyyGw"
  title="Split, offset, hash - no text duplication"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="dark"/>

There are [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-bluesky"/>more displacement map text effects](https://bsky.app/profile/anatudor.bsky.social) on Ana’s feed.

George Black said:

> Writing CSS for my site that uses modern features only available in Chrome or Safari, but not both. Eventual consistency — eventually it’ll look right in one browser… right?

Actually, yes! Most likely. For those that don’t know, the Interop Project is a collaboration between Chrome, Firefox, and Safari where they make certain features work consistently across their browsers. You can even vote on the features! Keen to learn more? Read what [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-webdev"/>Chrome](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2026-proposals) and [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-safari"/>WebKit](https://webkit.org/blog/17320/submit-your-ideas-for-interop-2026/) have said about Interop 2026. Finally, a massive shout-out to our very own [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-css-tricks"/>Sunkanmi Fafowora](https://css-tricks.com/author/sunkanmifafowora/) for [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-bluesky"/>saying what we’re all thinking](https://bsky.app/profile/sunkanmifafowora.bsky.social/post/3ma6nuiw2tk2e):

> Thank you to all who work very hard to expand and push the boundaries of what we can do with CSS. You’ve made my work and the work of millions of others so much easier. You’re not unnoticed, and I do hope you’re having an amazing day.

On that note, the CSS-Tricks team wishes you a very happy new year. May your websites be free of bugs and work in all (stable) browsers!

See you in 2026!
