*Serverless* architecture allows backend web services to be implemented on an as-needed basis. Rather than needing to maintain your own server configuration, architecting your software for serverless providers can minimize the overhead involved. Serverless applications are typically deployed from a Git repository into an environment that can scale up or down as needed.

This means that serverless functions can effectively “scale to zero” – a function or endpoint should consume no resources at all as long as it is not being accessed. A serverless application can be a single function, written in a language that is interpreted by your serverless computing provider (usually *Go*, *Python*, and *JavaScript*), as long as it can `return` some output. Although each serverless computing platform is essentially proprietary in terms of its runtime environment, they implement similar tools and similar principles.
