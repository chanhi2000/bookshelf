One of the (many!) features of Docker 0.6 is the new ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù mode for containers. It allows you to run some containers with (almost) all the capabilities of their host machine, regarding kernel features and device access.

Among the (many!) possibilities of the ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù mode, you can now run Docker within Docker itself. First, we will see how to make that happen; next, we will explain what is involved under the hood, and finally, we will show something even more powerful than Docker in Docker!

---

## See Docker-in-Docker in action

If you have Docker 0.6, all you have to do is:

```sh
docker run -privileged -t -i jpetazzo/dind
```

This will download my special Docker image (we will see later why it is special), and execute it in the new privileged mode. By default, it will run a local `docker` daemon, and drop you into a shell. In that shell, let‚Äôs try a classical ‚ÄúDocker 101‚Äù command:

```sh
docker run -t -i ubuntu bash
```

Note how the container ID changes as you transition from the container running Docker, to the innermost container!

---

## What‚Äôs special in my `dind` image?

Almost nothing! It is built with a regular [Dockerfile (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`jpetazzo/dind`)](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind/blob/master/Dockerfile). Let‚Äôs see what is in that Dockerfile.

First, it installs a few packages: `lxc` and `iptables` (because Docker needs them), and `ca-certificates` (because when communicating with the Docker index and registry, Docker needs to validate their SSL certificates).

The Dockerfile also indicates that `/var/lib/docker` should be a volume. This is important, because the filesystem of a container is an AUFS mountpoint, composed of multiple *branches*; and those branches have to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù filesystems (i.e. not AUFS mountpoints). In other words, `/var/lib/docker`, the place where Docker stores its containers, cannot be an AUFS filesystem. Therefore, we instruct Docker that this path should be a *volume*. Volumes have many purposes, but in this scenario, we use them as a pass-through to the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù filesystem of the host machine. The`/var/lib/docker` directory of the nested Docker will live somewhere in `/var/lib/docker/volumes` on the host system.

And of course, the Dockerfile injects the Docker binary in the image, as well as a [helper script (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`jpetazzo/dind`)](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind/blob/master/wrapdocker). The helper script deals with three things.

1. It ensures that the cgroup pseudo-filesystems are properly mounted, because Docker (or, more accurately, `lxc-start`) needs them.
2. It closes extraneous file descriptors which might have been leaked from the parent process. This is not strictly necessary, but you might notice weird side effects if you don‚Äôt do it; so I took care of it for you.
3. It checks if you specified a `PORT` environment variable through the `-e PORT=...` command-line option. If you did, the Docker daemon starts in the foreground, and listens for API requests on the specified TCP port. If you did not specify a `PORT` variable, it will start Docker in the background, and give you an interactive shell.

In the next section, I‚Äôll tell you why I think that this `PORT` environment variable can be *very* useful.

---

## Docker-as-a-Service

If you just want to experiment with Docker-in-Docker, just start the image interactively, as shown above. Now, let‚Äôs pretend that you want to provide Docker-as-a-Service. I‚Äôm not speaking about Containers-as-a-Service here, but whole Docker instances. Well, each time someone wants their own private Docker instance, just run this:

```sh
docker run -privileged -d -p 1234 -e PORT=1234 jpetazzo/dind
```

Then use `docker inspect` to retrieve the public port allocated to that container, and give it to your user. They will be able to create containers on this ‚Äúprivate Docker‚Äù by pointing their Docker client to the IP address and port that you gave them. (See [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Memcached-as-a-Service](http://memcachedasaservice.com/) for a similar example.)

Note, however, that there are serious security implications there: since the private Docker instances run in privileged mode, they can easily escalate to the host, and you probably don‚Äôt want this! If you really want to run something like this and expose it to the public, you will have to fine-tune the LXC template file, to restrict the capabilities and devices available to the Docker instances. In the future, Docker will allow fine-grained permission management; but for now, we think that the ability to switch between ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù and ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù is a great first step.

## Docker-in-Docker-in-Docker-in‚Ä¶

[![SONY DSC](https://docker.com/app/uploads/2013/08/DSC03438.jpg "- DSC03438")](https://docker.com/app/uploads/2013/08/DSC03438.jpg)

Can I Run Docker-in-Docker-in-Docker? Yes. When you are inside a privileged container, you can always nest one more level:

```sh
docker run -t -i -privileged jpetazzo/dind
```

And in the resulting container, you can repeat the process, *ad lib*.

Also, as you exit nested Docker containers, this will happen (note the root prompts):

```sh
root@975423921ac5:/# exit
root@6b2ae8bf2f10:/# exit
root@419a67dfdf27:/# exit
root@bc9f450caf22:/# exit
jpetazzo@tarrasque:~/Work/DOTCLOUD/dind$
```

At that point, you should blast Hans Zimmer‚Äôs [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Dream Is Collapsing](http://youtu.be/_IdA7aV4ftY) on your loudspeakers while twirling a spinning top üòÄ

## It doesn‚Äôt work!

While testing Docker-in-Docker in various environments, I found two possible problems.

It looks like the LXC tools cannot start nested containers if the devices control group is not in its own hierarchy. Check the content of `/proc/1/cgroup`: if `devices` is standing on a line on its own, you‚Äôre good. If you see that another control group is on the same line, Docker-in-Docker won‚Äôt work. The wrapper script will detect this situation and issue a warning. To work around the issue, you should stop all running containers, unmount all the control groups, and remount them one by one, each in its own hierarchy.

Also, if you use AppArmor, you need a special policy to support nested containers. If Docker-in-Docker doesn‚Äôt work, check your kernel log (with `dmesg`); if you see messages related to AppArmor, you can start Docker in unconfined mode, like this:

```sh
docker run -privileged -lxc-conf="aa_profile=unconfined" -t -i dind
```
