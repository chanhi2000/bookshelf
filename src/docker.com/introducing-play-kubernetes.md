Every month for the last year, thousands of people have used [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Play with Docker](https://play-with-docker.com/) and the accompanying hands-on [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Play with Docker Classroom](https://training.play-with-docker.com/) training site. These sites allow you to use and learn Docker entirely within your own browser, without installing anything. Last summer, we quietly launched the companion site [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Play with Kubernetes](http://play-with-kubernetes.com/), to give people a full command line while learning Kubernetes on the command line. And today we’re launching a new Kubernetes training site, the [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Play with Kubernetes Classroom](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com).

The [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-globe"/>Play with Kubernetes Classroom](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com) is a workshop environment just like the Play with Docker Classroom. We currently have an extensive Kubernetes workshop originally based on [Jérôme Petazzoni’s (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"/>`jpetazzo`)](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo) [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-globe"/>Container Training](http://container.training/) Kubernetes workshop. But instead of doing it all locally or setting up VMs in the cloud, you can now run through the workshop entirely in the browser.

Like the Play with Docker Classroom, we’ll be curating contributions of additional labs from the community. So give Kubernetes in your browser a try, and then come on over to the [Play with Kubernetes repository (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`play-with-docker/play-with-kubernetes.github.io`)](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-kubernetes.github.io/) to share your own tutorials with the community.
