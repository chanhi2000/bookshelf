Are you tired of the same old developer portfolios? Want to stand out to potential employers or clients?

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use Kaboom.js to craft a 2D game that doubles as your developer portfolio! JSLegendDev developed this course.

In the tech world, showing is better than telling. A developer portfolio is your visual resume, showcasing your skills, projects, and creativity. A standout portfolio can make the difference in landing your dream job or attracting freelance clients.

Kaboom.js is a JavaScript library designed to make programming games fun and accessible. With Kaboom.js, you don't need to be a gaming industry veteran to create engaging and visually appealing games. It's a perfect tool for developers who want to showcase their coding prowess in a unique and interactive way.
