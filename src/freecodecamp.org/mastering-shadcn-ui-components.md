## What is Shadcn?

Shadcn is not your typical component library. Instead of installing it as a dependency through npm, Shadcn offers a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components that you can copy and paste directly into your project. This unique approach allows developers to have complete control over their components, enabling greater customization and integration flexibility.

The Shadcn components are designed to be easily integrated into any React or Next.js project. They come with built-in styling options and support theming through CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes, making it simple to maintain a consistent look and feel across your application.

This course covers all the main UI components provided by Shadcn, offering a thorough introduction and practical examples to help you get started quickly.
