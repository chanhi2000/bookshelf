## What Are AI Agents and Large Language Models?

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought forth a transformative synergy between large language models (LLMs) and AI agents.

[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>AI agents are autonomous systems](https://simform.com/blog/ai-agent/) designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute actions to achieve specific goals. They exhibit characteristics such as autonomy, perception, reactivity, reasoning, decision-making, learning, communication, and goal-orientation.

On the other hand, LLMs are sophisticated AI systems that utilize deep learning techniques and vast datasets to understand, generate, and predict human-like text.

These models, such as GPT-4, Mistral, LLama, have [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>demonstrated remarkable capabilities](https://techtarget.com/whatis/definition/large-language-model-LLM) in natural language processing tasks, including text generation, language translation, and conversational agents.

## Levels of AI Agents

<PDF url="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02831" />

AI agents can be classified into different levels based on their capabilities and complexity. According to a paper on arXiv, AI agents are categorized into five levels:

1. **Level 1 (L1)**: AI agents as research assistants, where scientists set hypotheses and specify tasks to achieve objectives.
2. **Level 2 (L2)**: AI agents that can autonomously perform specific tasks within a defined scope, such as data analysis or simple decision-making.
3. **Level 3 (L3)**: AI agents capable of learning from experience and adapting to new situations, enhancing their decision-making processes.
4. **Level 4 (L4)**: AI agents with advanced reasoning and problem-solving abilities, capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks.
5. **Level 5 (L5)**: Fully autonomous AI agents that can operate independently in dynamic environments, making decisions and taking actions without human intervention.

## Limitations of Large Language Models

### Training Costs and Resource Constraints

Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and PaLM have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by leveraging deep learning techniques and vast datasets.

But these advancements come at a significant cost. Training LLMs requires substantial computational resources, often involving thousands of GPUs and extensive energy consumption.  

According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>training cost for GPT-4](https://wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-the-age-of-giant-ai-models-is-already-over/) exceeded $100 million. This aligns with the model's reported scale and complexity, with estimates suggesting it has around 1 trillion parameters. However, other sources offer different figures:

1. A leaked report indicated that GPT-4's training costs were approximately [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>$63 million](https://plainswipe.com/gpt-4-details-leaked/index.html), considering the computational power and training duration.
2. As of mid-2023, some estimates suggested that [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>training a model](https://youtu.be/kQSS-q7epN0) similar to GPT-4 could cost around $20 million and take about 55 days, reflecting advancements in efficiency.

This high cost of training and maintaining LLMs limits their widespread adoption and scalability.

### Data Limitations and Bias

The performance of LLMs is heavily dependent on the quality and diversity of the training data. Despite being trained on massive datasets, LLMs can still exhibit biases present in the data, leading to skewed or inappropriate outputs. These biases can [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>manifest in various forms](https://elastic.co/what-is/large-language-models), including gender, racial, and cultural biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and misinformation.

Also, the static nature of the training data means that LLMs may not be up-to-date with the latest information, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic environments.

### Specialization and Complexity

While LLMs excel in general tasks, they often struggle with specialized tasks that require domain-specific knowledge and high-level complexity.

For example, tasks in fields such as medicine, law, and scientific research demand a deep understanding of specialized terminology and nuanced reasoning, which LLMs may not possess inherently. This limitation necessitates the integration of additional layers of expertise and fine-tuning to make LLMs effective in specialized applications.

### Input and Sensory Limitations

LLMs primarily process text-based inputs, which restricts their ability to interact with the world in a multimodal manner. While they can generate and understand text, they lack the capability to process visual, auditory, or sensory inputs directly.

This limitation hinders their application in fields that require comprehensive sensory integration, such as robotics and autonomous systems. For instance, an LLM cannot interpret visual data from a camera or auditory data from a microphone without additional processing layers.

### Communication and Interaction Constraints

The current communication capabilities of LLMs are predominantly text-based, which limits their ability to engage in more immersive and interactive forms of communication.

For example, while LLMs can generate text responses, they cannot produce video content or holographic representations, which are increasingly important in virtual and augmented reality applications ([<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>read more here](https://techtarget.com/whatis/definition/large-language-model-LLM)). This constraint reduces the effectiveness of LLMs in environments that demand rich, multimodal interactions.

## How to Overcome Limitations with AI Agents

AI agents offer a promising solution to many of the limitations faced by LLMs. These agents are designed to operate autonomously, perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute actions to achieve specific goals. By integrating AI agents with LLMs, it is possible to enhance their capabilities and address their inherent limitations.

1. **Enhanced Context and Memory**: AI agents can [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>maintain context](https://thenewstack.io/ai-agents-key-concepts-and-how-they-overcome-llm-limitations/) over multiple interactions, allowing for more coherent and contextually relevant responses. This capability is particularly useful in applications that require long-term memory and continuity, such as customer service and personal assistants.
2. **Multimodal Integration**: AI agents can incorporate [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>sensory inputs from various sources](https://simform.com/blog/ai-agent/), such as cameras, microphones, and sensors, enabling LLMs to process and respond to visual, auditory, and sensory data. This integration is crucial for applications in robotics and autonomous systems.
3. **Specialized Knowledge and Expertise**: AI agents can be fine-tuned with domain-specific knowledge, enhancing the ability of LLMs to perform specialized tasks. This approach allows for the creation of expert systems that can handle complex queries in fields such as medicine, law, and scientific research.
4. **Interactive and Immersive Communication**: AI agents can facilitate more immersive forms of communication by generating video content, controlling holographic displays, and interacting with virtual and augmented reality environments. This capability expands the application of LLMs in fields that require rich, multimodal interactions.

While large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, they are not without limitations. The high costs of training, data biases, specialization challenges, sensory limitations, and communication constraints present significant hurdles.

But the integration of AI agents offers a viable pathway to overcoming these limitations. By leveraging the strengths of AI agents, it is possible to enhance the functionality, adaptability, and applicability of LLMs, paving the way for more advanced and versatile AI systems.
