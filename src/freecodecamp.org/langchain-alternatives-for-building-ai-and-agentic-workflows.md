Building AI and agentic workflows is at the core of modern AI development in 2025. And LangChain has been the go-to framework for creating AI applications for a while now. But some developers are seeking alternatives that offer more flexibility, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness.

While LangChain has enabled rapid development of LLM-powered apps with tools for chaining, agents, and memory, its heavy abstraction, complex debugging, and difficulty with real-world use often make it more suited for prototyping than production-level applications.

In this article, weâ€™ll explore some powerful LangChain alternatives you can try out thatâ€™ll help you build effective AI and agentic workflows. Iâ€™ll go through each oneâ€™s key features and best use cases so you can get a good idea of how it might help you.

## What is an AI and Agentic Workflow?

An **AI workflow** refers to a series of tasks executed by AI systems, typically following a predefined sequence. It handles tasks like data extraction, processing, and generating output based on clear instructions.

An **agentic workflow** goes a step further. It involves AI taking initiative, making decisions, and managing tasks autonomously. In agentic workflows, AI adapts its actions based on its environment or predefined goals, often without human intervention.

In short, an AI workflow becomes more "agentic" as it begins to think, decide, and act independently, acting like an intelligent agent. The more decisions AI can make on its own, the less it needs to be prompted by a human.

Now that itâ€™s clear what an AI and agentic workflow is, letâ€™s look at some other tools and frameworks that could serve as LangChain alternatives, each offering unique capabilities and approaches that you can use to build your AI and agentic workflows.
