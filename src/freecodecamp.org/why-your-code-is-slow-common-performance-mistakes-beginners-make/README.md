Maybe you‚Äôve experienced something like this before: you‚Äôve written code that works, but when you hit ‚Äúrun,‚Äù it takes forever. You stare at the spinner, wondering if it‚Äôs faster to just solve the problem by hand.

But you end up looking something like this‚Ä¶ üò≠‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

![6 year old me thinking the game would load faster if i act like don't care  ORIGINALWOLFF - iFunny](https://img.ifunny.co/images/9eeae78f1bc92e6dc422c5e6af2b5a768913d2e4fa9df2d0df499c1202dfe539_1.jpg)

Here‚Äôs the truth: slow code doesn‚Äôt have to be the end of the world. And it‚Äôs a rite of passage if you‚Äôre a developer.

When you‚Äôre learning to code, you‚Äôre focused on making things *work*‚Äînot making them fast. But eventually, you‚Äôll hit a wall: your app freezes, your data script takes hours, or your game lags like a PowerPoint slideshow.

The difference between working code and blazing-fast code often comes down to avoiding a few common mistakes. Mistakes that are easy to make when you‚Äôre starting out, like using the wrong tool for the job, writing unnecessary code, or accidentally torturing your computer with hidden inefficiencies.

I‚Äôve been there. I once wrote a ‚Äúquick‚Äù script to analyze data. It ran for 3 hours. Turns out, changing one line of code cut it to 10 seconds. Yes I was dumb when I was learning ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt want you to be, too.

That‚Äôs the power of understanding performance.

In this guide, I‚Äôll break down seven common mistakes that can really tank your code‚Äôs speed‚Äîand how to fix them.

## üöÄ Final Thoughts: Lessons Learned the Hard Way

Thanks for reading! These are some of the tips I‚Äôve personally bookmarked for myself‚Äîthings I‚Äôve learned the hard way while coding, talking to dev friends, and working on real projects.

When I first started, I used to guess why my code was slow instead of measuring. I‚Äôd optimize random parts of my code and still wonder why things weren‚Äôt getting faster. Over time, I realized that pro developers don‚Äôt just ‚Äúwrite fast code‚Äù by instinct‚Äîthey use tools, measure, and optimize what actually matters.

I wrote this to save you from making the same mistakes I did. Hopefully, now you have a clearer roadmap to writing faster, more efficient code‚Äîwithout the frustration I went through! üöÄ

If you found this helpful, bookmark it for later, and feel free to share it with a fellow dev who might be struggling with slow code too.

Happy coding! üòä
