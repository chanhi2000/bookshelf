Did you know you can create PC games using JavaScript?

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about making a Flappy Bird-like game in JavaScript with the KAPLAY library, and how to use Tauri to package your game for installation on a PC. This course is great for both beginners and experienced developers who want to dive into game development and learn about modern tools and libraries that can make the process smoother and more efficient. This course was created by JSLegendDev.

## Why Learn These Technologies?

- **JavaScript and KAPLAY:** JavaScript is a versatile language that's widely used in web development. The KAPLAY library is a game development library that simplifies many common tasks, allowing you to focus on creating your game rather than getting bogged down by technical details.
- **Tauri:** Tauri is a toolkit that lets you build smaller, faster, and more secure desktop applications with a web frontend. By learning Tauri, you can package your JavaScript game into a native application that can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing a seamless experience for users.
