## Why Pursue the AWS Certified AI Practitioner Certification?

The AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification is ideal for professionals who are familiar with AI/ML technologies on AWS but do not necessarily build AI/ML solutions. This certification can significantly enhance your competitive edge, positioning you for career growth and higher earnings.

According to a November 2023 AWS study, employers are willing to pay significantly more for AI-skilled workers across various roles. For instance, AI expertise can lead to a 43% salary increase in sales and marketing, 42% in finance, 41% in business operations, and 47% in IT. By obtaining this certification, you can demonstrate your proficiency in AI and ML, making you a more attractive candidate in the job market.
