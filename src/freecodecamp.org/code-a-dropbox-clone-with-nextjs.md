Building modern full-stack applications requires a strong grasp of various interconnected technologies. And what better way to learn than by creating a real-world project that mimics a widely used tool like Dropbox? That’s exactly what this new course offers. Through the development of "Droply," a Dropbox-inspired file management app, you'll dive into the nuts and bolts of building robust, scalable, and user-friendly software using today's most in-demand tools.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about building a full-stack application using Next.js, Clerk, Neon (Postgres), Drizzle ORM, ImageKit, Zod, React Hook Form, and Hero UI. Created by popular instructor Hitesh Choudhary, this course is designed for developers who want a practical, hands-on approach to mastering full-stack development. You’ll start by planning the application architecture and end with a fully functioning file storage system, complete with user authentication, file uploads, custom database migrations, and a polished UI.

The core of the application is built on Next.js, which serves both the frontend and backend. You'll learn how to create dynamic and efficient React components while handling server-side operations in a unified framework. Clerk handles user authentication, allowing you to create seamless signup and sign-in flows complete with OTP and email verification, all while customizing the interface to reflect your own branding.

Database interactions are powered by Neon, a modern serverless Postgres solution, and Drizzle, a type-safe ORM that makes schema definition and database querying both powerful and approachable. You’ll learn to define and manage hierarchical folder structures using self-referencing tables, run migrations, and inspect your schema with Drizzle Studio.

For file storage, the course integrates ImageKit, a media optimization platform that supports uploading, processing, and managing files with ease. You’ll also explore how to limit file types and use AI-powered features to enhance media handling. On the data validation side, Zod ensures that your application only processes clean, expected input.

On the UI front, Hero UI components are used to design clean and functional interfaces. You'll see how to integrate pre-built UI elements and customize them to fit your application’s needs. Beyond the tech, the course delves into project planning, including how to approach complex builds, break them into manageable components, and design thoughtful database schemas before writing a single line of code.

With built-in assignments, this course ensures you're not just watching—you're actively building and experimenting. By the end, you'll have gained real experience building a full-stack application, understood how modern tools fit together, and developed the confidence to create your own production-grade software.
