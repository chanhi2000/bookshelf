## Introduction to Minimal APIs

Imagine working in a codebase with numerous endpoints, making it quite large and complex. Traditionally, building an API in ASP.NET Core involves using controllers, routing, middleware, and a significant amount of boilerplate code. But there are two approaches to building an API in ASP.NET Core: the traditional way and the minimal way.

The traditional way is familiar to most developers, involving controllers and extensive infrastructure code. The minimal way, introduced in `.NET 6`, allows you to create APIs with minimal code and zero boilerplate. This approach simplifies the development process, enabling you to focus on writing business logic rather than dealing with infrastructure code.

Minimal APIs are lightweight, fast, and perfect for building small to medium-sized APIs. They are ideal for prototyping, building microservices, or creating simple APIs that don't require much complexity. In this handbook, we'll explore the world of minimal APIs in .NET 6 and learn how to create a fully functional bookstore API from scratch.
