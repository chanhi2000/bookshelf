Smart contracts are like digital agreements that run on blockchain technology, making transactions automatic and secure. While many people use Ethereum and Solidity to create these contracts, there are other options that can be just as powerful.

One great combination is using Rust with the Gear Protocol. In this guide, I'll show you how to build and deploy a smart contract using Rust and the Gear Protocol. Whether you're new to this or have some experience, this article will help you get started with clear and easy-to-follow steps.

::: note Prerequisites

1. Have basic Rust knowledge.
2. Having a basic understanding of decentralization.

## Conclusion

As demonstrated, developing a smart contract with Gear Protocol becomes straightforward once you grasp the communication message concepts. By following the steps outlined, you can start building your own projects with confidence.

While this article didn't delve into handling transactions such as token transfers, minting, or NFTs, I will cover these topics in a future article.

For now, you can explore the repository of the project we built together: [Battle-Showdown (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`rockyessel/battle-showdown`)](https://github.com/rockyessel/battle-showdown), and if you have any question to ask, feel free to reach @rockyessel on X.
