Here‚Äôs a graph that shows the journey of **two types** of coders:

![Image of clean code vs bad code graph chart](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/c6ubf77uwipf4gtucw8q.png)

- **‚ö†Ô∏è The Messy Coder (Red line):** Starts fast but crashes hard. The more lines they write, the more trouble they make.
- **‚ö° The Clean Coder (Blue line):** Starts slow but stays consistent. Growth doesn‚Äôt stop ‚Äî it accelerates.

ü´µ Now, you decide which line you want to follow.
