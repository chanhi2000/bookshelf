Now let me show you the best practices and summarise our 12 Clean Code design principles to help you write clean code for agile application development.

## 🔎 Common Code Smells and How to Fix Them

- 💊 Duplication: If you're copying code, you’re creating more work for yourself. Extract it into a function, and do it right.
- 🛤️ Long methods: If your method needs a scroll bar, it's doing too much. Break it down, keep it focused.
- 👑 King objects: No class should be doing everything. Simplify responsibilities, or your codebase will become messy.

---

## 💬 Effective Commenting Practices

- 💭 When to comment: Only comment if the code isn't clear. If it is, comments are just clutter.
- 🫗 Clarity: Comments should tell why, not what. If your code needs explaining, it might be too complex.
- 🌴 Avoid redundancy: Don't comment what's obvious. If your function is addNumbers, don't comment it does that.

## 🧼 Refactoring Techniques for Clean Code

- 🏭 Extract methods: Big methods? Break them down. It's not just about cleanliness –– it's about control.
- 🫕 Rename variables: If your variable names don’t shout their purpose, change and improve them. Precision in naming is precision in thought.
- 🍃 Simplify conditionals: If your conditionals look like algebra, simplify them. If a == true, just write if(a).

---

## 🧪 Testing and Clean Code

- 🧙 Unit tests: Test every piece of code like you're interrogating a suspect. No stone unturned.
- 🏇 TDD (Test Driven Development): Write tests first. It's not just about catching bugs, it's about knowing exactly what your code should do before you write it.
- 🧽 Clean tests: Your tests should be as clean as your code. If they're messy, they’re not going to be helpful.

---

## 🐛 Error Handling and Clean Code

- ⁉️ Exceptions: Use them. They're not just for errors, they're also for keeping your code clean from error clutter.
- 🖍️ Fail fast: If something's wrong, stop right there. Don't let errors add up. Deal with them immediately.
- 🚨 Logging: Log like you're documenting a crime scene. Clear, precise, and only what's necessary.

---

## 🌱 Code Reviews and Clean Code

- 🚢 Process: Have a system. No cowboy coding. Review, critique, improve.
- 🔪 Tools: Use tools that make reviews easy. They're not just for catching mistakes, they're also for teaching discipline.
- 🧦 Culture: Cultivate a culture where feedback is gold. Help your team learn how to handle and receive critiques.
