When you get stuck writing code, you might turn to AI. But let me tell you something: AI can‚Äôt save you if your code is a mess.

It‚Äôs like building a house on sand. Sure, it stands for a while, but one strong gust of wind or big wave, and it collapses.

Remember: AI is just a tool. If you don‚Äôt know how to write clean, scalable applications, you're setting yourself up for failure.

If you can‚Äôt maintain the code you write, you‚Äôre in trouble.

I‚Äôve seen it over and over again: developers who know five programming languages. They can build apps, websites, software. They know algorithms and data structures like the back of their hand.

But when faced with a large project or someone else‚Äôs messy code, they crumble.

They‚Äôre like an aerospace engineer who designs and builds their own planes but doesn‚Äôt know how to fly them. They crash into their own code.

This was me...once upon a time. I‚Äôd write thousands of lines of code, only to realize I couldn‚Äôt even understand what I wrote last week. It was chaos for me.

But then it hit me ‚Äî every developer struggles with this. It wasn't about how much I knew. It was about how I organized and structured what I knew. In other words, it was about knowing the art of programming itself.

I decided to escape this trap. After five months of intense work ‚Äî four to five hours a day writing, designing, and researching ‚Äî I created something I wish I had when I started programming. A book that‚Äôs a complete beginner‚Äôs guide: **Clean Code Zero to One.**

If you want to learn more about the book, I give you all the details at the end of this tutorial. So read on to learn more about writing clean code.
