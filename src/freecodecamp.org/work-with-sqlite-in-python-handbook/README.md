SQLite is one of the most popular relational database management systems (RDBMS). It’s lightweight, meaning that it doesn’t take up much space on your system. One of its best features is that it’s serverless, so you don’t need to install or manage a separate server to use it.

Instead, it stores everything in a simple file on your computer. It also requires zero configuration, so there’s no complicated setup process, making it perfect for beginners and small projects.

SQLite is a great choice for small to medium applications because it’s easy to use, fast, and can handle most tasks that bigger databases can do, but without the hassle of managing extra software. Whether you're building a personal project or prototyping a new app, SQLite is a solid option to get things up and running quickly.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to work with SQLite using Python. Here’s what we’re going to cover in this tutorial:
