## What is Godot?

Godot is an open-source game engine that you can use to build 2D and 3D games.

It has become very popular in the last few years, with robust features that make it a great tool in the game development world, without the heavy resource demands of some other game engines. This makes it a practical choice for creators looking for efficiency and high performance.

Its open-source license is great for independent developers and small teams, as it doesn’t come with any licensing fees. You’ll retain full ownership and control over the games and projects that you create with Godot.

This flexibility makes game development more approachable for everyone.

Godot also has its own user-friendly scripting language and node-based system. Its scripting language, called GDScript, is similar to Python and is easy to learn for beginners. Its intuitive node-based system simplifies the process of creating both 2D and 3D games.

By learning Godot, you’ll be taking your first steps into a career in game development.

::: tip

This course is perfect for anyone who wants to start developing video games. It covers core concepts in GDScript.
