CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general-purpose processing, an approach known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). Learning CUDA opens up a world of possibilities in fields such as scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning, where performance and speed are critical.

We just posted a 12-hour CUDA course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. This comprehensive course, created by Elliot Arledge, is designed to equip you with the skills needed to use the power of GPUs for high-performance computing tasks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to expand your skill set, this course offers valuable insights into the world of CUDA programming.
