## Data Analysis in Bioengineering

Data analysis is a cornerstone of bioengineering, enabling researchers to interpret vast datasets, identify patterns, and derive meaningful insights. Python, with its extensive libraries, is a preferred language for bioinformatics and data science tasks. Below are several code examples demonstrating data analysis techniques in bioengineering.

### Genomic Data Visualization

Visualizing genomic data helps in understanding genetic variations and their implications. The following example uses `pandas` and `matplotlib` to visualize single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across different chromosomes.

```py :collapsed-lines
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load SNP data
snp_data = pd.read_csv('snp_data.csv')  # Columns: Chromosome, Position, SNP_Type

# Plot SNP distribution per chromosome
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for chromosome in snp_data['Chromosome'].unique():
    chr_data = snp_data[snp_data['Chromosome'] == chromosome]
    plt.scatter(chr_data['Position'], [chromosome]*len(chr_data), label=f'Chr {chromosome}', alpha=0.6)

plt.xlabel('Position')
plt.ylabel('Chromosome')
plt.title('SNP Distribution Across Chromosomes')
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This script reads SNP data from a CSV file, filters the data by each chromosome, and plots the SNP positions using scatter plots. Each chromosome is represented on the y-axis, allowing for a clear visualization of SNP distribution across the genome.

### Differential Gene Expression Analysis

Identifying differentially expressed genes between conditions is crucial in understanding disease mechanisms. This example uses the `statsmodels` library to perform statistical analysis on gene expression data.

```py :collapsed-lines
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load gene expression data
expression_data = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv')  # Rows: Genes, Columns: Samples
conditions = pd.read_csv('conditions.csv')  # Columns: Sample, Condition

# Prepare design matrix
conditions_encoded = pd.get_dummies(conditions['Condition'], drop_first=True)
X = sm.add_constant(conditions_encoded)
results = {}

# Perform t-test for each gene
for gene in expression_data['Gene']:
    y = expression_data[expression_data['Gene'] == gene].iloc[0, 1:]
    model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
    p_value = model.pvalues['Condition_Treated']
    results[gene] = p_value

# Convert results to DataFrame
results_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(results, orient='index', columns=['p_value'])
significant_genes = results_df[results_df['p_value'] < 0.05]

print(f"Number of significantly differentially expressed genes: {len(significant_genes)}")
print(significant_genes)
```

This script performs differential gene expression analysis by fitting an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model for each gene, comparing treated versus control conditions. Genes with p-values below 0.05 are considered significantly differentially expressed.

## Simulation and Modeling in Bioengineering

Simulating biological systems allows for the prediction of behaviors under various conditions without the need for extensive laboratory experiments. Tools like `SciPy` and `NumPy` are instrumental in building and solving biological models.

### Modeling Enzyme Kinetics with Michaelis-Menten Equation

The Michaelis-Menten equation describes the kinetics of enzyme-mediated reactions. This example uses `SciPy` to fit experimental data to the equation.

```py :collapsed-lines
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

# Define Michaelis-Menten equation
def michaelis_menten(S, Vmax, Km):
    return (Vmax * S) / (Km + S)

# Experimental data: Substrate concentration (S) and reaction rate (V)
S = np.array([0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100])
V = np.array([0.05, 0.2, 0.35, 0.55, 0.8, 0.95, 1.1, 1.15, 1.2])

# Fit the model to data
popt, pcov = curve_fit(michaelis_menten, S, V, bounds=(0, np.inf))
Vmax, Km = popt
print(f"Estimated Vmax: {Vmax}")
print(f"Estimated Km: {Km}")

# Plot data and fitted curve
S_fit = np.linspace(0, 100, 500)
V_fit = michaelis_menten(S_fit, Vmax, Km)

plt.scatter(S, V, label='Experimental Data')
plt.plot(S_fit, V_fit, 'r-', label='Fitted Michaelis-Menten')
plt.xlabel('Substrate Concentration (mM)')
plt.ylabel('Reaction Rate (μM/min)')
plt.title('Enzyme Kinetics: Michaelis-Menten Fit')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384595224/a6e4b67e-3d3f-4dec-8cbb-9c4a858db23d.png)

This script fits experimental substrate concentration and reaction rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear curve fitting. The estimated parameters `Vmax` and `Km` provide insights into the enzyme's efficiency and affinity for the substrate.

### Population Growth Modeling with Logistic Equation

The logistic growth model describes population growth with a carrying capacity. This example simulates population growth over time using the logistic equation.

```py :collapsed-lines
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import odeint

# Define logistic growth differential equation
def logistic_growth(P, t, r, K):
    dPdt = r * P * (1 - P / K)
    return dPdt

# Parameters
r = 0.3  # Growth rate
K = 1000  # Carrying capacity
P0 = 10  # Initial population
t = np.linspace(0, 30, 300)  # Time

# Solve ODE
P = odeint(logistic_growth, P0, t, args=(r, K))

# Plot results
plt.plot(t, P, label='Population')
plt.axhline(y=K, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Carrying Capacity')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Population')
plt.title('Logistic Population Growth')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

![b9d7e849-ad13-4671-924f-12ee19aa3faf](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384623185/b9d7e849-ad13-4671-924f-12ee19aa3faf.png)

This script models population growth using the logistic equation, which incorporates the carrying capacity `K` to prevent indefinite growth. The solution is obtained using the `odeint` function from `SciPy`, and the population dynamics are visualized over time.

## Control Systems in Bioengineering Devices

Control systems are vital in bioengineering devices to maintain desired states and respond to external stimuli. Python's control systems library (`control`) facilitates the design and analysis of these systems.

### Designing a PID Controller for a Temperature Regulation System

A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller adjusts system inputs based on the error between desired and actual temperatures. This example designs a PID controller for a simulated temperature system.

```py :collapsed-lines
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import control as ctrl

# Define system parameters
K = 2.0  # Gain
tau = 5.0  # Time constant
system = ctrl.TransferFunction([K], [tau, 1])

# Define PID controller parameters
Kp = 3.0
Ki = 1.0
Kd = 0.5
controller = ctrl.TransferFunction([Kd, Kp, Ki], [1, 0])

# Closed-loop system
closed_loop = ctrl.feedback(controller*system, 1)

# Step response
t, y = ctrl.step_response(closed_loop)

# Plot response
plt.plot(t, y, label='Closed-loop Response')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Temperature')
plt.title('PID Controller for Temperature Regulation')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384656125/3118f03b-392b-46a2-8f6b-151d302711f1.png)

This script models a temperature regulation system using a first-order transfer function. A PID controller is designed with specified proportional, integral, and derivative gains. The closed-loop system's step response illustrates the controller's effectiveness in achieving the desired temperature.

### Stabilizing a Biological Oscillator

Biological oscillators, such as circadian rhythms, require stabilization to maintain consistent cycles. This example demonstrates stabilizing a simple oscillator using feedback control.

```py :collapsed-lines
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import odeint

# Define oscillator with feedback control
def oscillator_with_feedback(state, t, alpha, beta, gamma):
    x, y = state
    dxdt = alpha * (y - x)
    dydt = x * (gamma - x) - y
    return [dxdt, dydt]

# Parameters
alpha = 10.0
beta = 28.0
gamma = 8.0/3.0

# Initial state
state0 = [1.0, 1.0]

# Time points
t = np.linspace(0, 50, 10000)

# Integrate ODE
states = odeint(oscillator_with_feedback, state0, t, args=(alpha, beta, gamma))

# Plot trajectory
plt.plot(states[:,0], states[:,1])
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.title('Stabilized Biological Oscillator')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384683258/3999bdac-f7d6-4b31-bb12-d2f6836c1d0b.png)

This script simulates a stabilized biological oscillator using a modified Lorenz system with feedback control parameters. By adjusting `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma`, the system can achieve stable oscillatory behavior, mimicking biological rhythms.

## Machine Learning in Bioengineering

Machine learning techniques are increasingly employed in bioengineering for predictive modeling, classification, and pattern recognition. Libraries like `scikit-learn` and `TensorFlow` facilitate the implementation of these techniques.

### Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions

Predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential for understanding cellular functions. This example uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify potential PPIs based on feature vectors.

```py :collapsed-lines
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('ppi_data.csv')  # Columns: Feature1, Feature2, ..., Label

# Features and labels
X = data.drop('Label', axis=1)
y = data['Label']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train SVM classifier
svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')
svm.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = svm.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Evaluation
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384709365/a341f845-c4e4-417c-a0c7-1df42807f73e.png)

This script trains an SVM classifier to predict PPIs using labeled feature data. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, standardized, and then used to train and evaluate the SVM model. The confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the model's performance.

### Deep Learning for Cell Image Classification

Classifying cell images is crucial in medical diagnostics. This example uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with `TensorFlow` and `Keras` to classify cell images into different categories.

```py :collapsed-lines
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Data preparation
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, horizontal_flip=True, rotation_range=20)
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'cell_images/train',
    target_size=(64, 64),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary')

validation_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'cell_images/validation',
    target_size=(64, 64),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='binary')

# Build CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
history = model.fit(
    train_generator,
    steps_per_epoch=100,
    epochs=20,
    validation_data=validation_generator,
    validation_steps=50)

# Evaluate model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(validation_generator)
print(f'Validation Accuracy: {accuracy*100:.2f}%')
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384730731/64d4c5e8-750c-4201-af4f-15ebb165b2dc.png)

This script constructs a CNN for binary classification of cell images. The model includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for classification. Data augmentation is applied to the training data to improve model generalization.

## Natural Language Processing in Bioengineering

Natural Language Processing (NLP) facilitates the extraction of information from scientific literature and the automation of documentation tasks. Libraries like `nltk`, `spaCy`, and `transformers` are commonly used in bioengineering applications.

### Extracting Gene Names from Scientific Articles

Extracting gene names from text is essential for knowledge extraction and database population. This example uses `spaCy` for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify gene names in scientific abstracts.

```py :collapsed-lines
import spacy

# Load pre-trained spaCy model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Sample abstract
abstract = """
The interaction between BRCA1 and RAD51 is critical for the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. 
Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers.
"""

# Process text
doc = nlp(abstract)

# Extract gene names (assuming they are tagged as ORG for this example)
gene_names = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ == 'ORG']

print("Extracted Gene Names:", gene_names)
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384760854/05a0d55b-0f41-4631-9c81-e6137b341a0f.png)

This script processes a scientific abstract to extract gene names using spaCy's NER capabilities. While spaCy's pre-trained models may not be optimized for gene names, this example demonstrates the approach. For more accurate gene name extraction, custom models or domain-specific libraries like `BioBERT` can be employed.

### Summarizing Biomedical Literature with Transformer Models

Summarizing biomedical literature helps researchers quickly grasp the essence of extensive research. This example uses the `transformers` library to generate summaries of biomedical abstracts.

```py :collapsed-lines
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize summarization pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

# Sample abstract
abstract = """
The CRISPR-Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing by allowing precise modifications to DNA sequences.
Its applications range from basic research to therapeutic interventions for genetic disorders.
Despite its potential, challenges such as off-target effects and delivery mechanisms remain.
Ongoing research focuses on improving specificity and developing efficient delivery vectors.
"""

# Generate summary
summary = summarizer(abstract, max_length=50, min_length=25, do_sample=False)

print("Summary:", summary[0]['summary_text'])
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384782924/bd82df45-8fb7-4305-aef6-aed653e6511d.png)

This script utilizes a pre-trained BART model to summarize a biomedical abstract. The `pipeline` abstraction simplifies the process, allowing for easy integration of powerful transformer models in bioengineering workflows.

## Security and Privacy in Bioengineering Data Handling

Handling sensitive bioengineering data necessitates robust security and privacy measures. This section provides code examples demonstrating encryption and secure data storage practices.

### Encrypting Biomedical Data with Fernet

Encrypting biomedical data ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access. This example uses the `cryptography` library's Fernet module for symmetric encryption.

```py :collapsed-lines
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import pandas as pd

# Generate encryption key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
print(f"Encryption Key: {key.decode()}")  # Store securely

# Load biomedical data
data = pd.read_csv('biomedical_data.csv')

# Convert DataFrame to bytes
data_bytes = data.to_csv(index=False).encode()

# Encrypt data
encrypted_data = cipher_suite.encrypt(data_bytes)

# Save encrypted data to file
with open('biomedical_data_encrypted.bin', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(encrypted_data)

print("Data encrypted and saved successfully.")
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736384805221/d46ec60b-da4c-4cd0-ab7f-8a41a3e373ff.png)

This script generates a symmetric encryption key, encrypts a biomedical dataset, and saves the encrypted data to a binary file. Proper key management is crucial—the encryption key must be stored securely to allow data decryption when needed.

### Secure Data Transmission with SSL/TLS

Transmitting biomedical data securely over networks is essential to prevent data breaches. This example demonstrates setting up a secure server-client communication using SSL/TLS in Python.

::: tabs

@tab:active Server Code

```py :collapsed-lines
import socket
import ssl

# Create socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(('localhost', 8443))
server_socket.listen(5)
print("Server listening on port 8443...")

# Wrap socket with SSL
context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
context.load_cert_chain(certfile='server.crt', keyfile='server.key')

while True:
    client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
    conn = context.wrap_socket(client_socket, server_side=True)
    print(f"Connection from {addr}")

    data = conn.recv(1024)
    if data:
        print(f"Received: {data.decode()}")
        conn.sendall(b"Data received securely.")
    conn.close()

:::

This setup establishes a secure server-client communication channel using SSL/TLS. The server listens for incoming connections, wraps the socket with SSL using a certificate and key, and securely receives data from clients. The client connects to the server using an SSL context, sends sensitive data, and receives confirmation. 

::: note

In production, proper certificate verification should be enforced to ensure security.

## Leveraging Cloud Computing for Bioengineering Applications

Cloud computing provides scalable resources for bioengineering applications, facilitating large-scale data processing and storage. This section includes examples of using cloud services for bioengineering tasks.

### Uploading and Processing Data on AWS S3 with Boto3

Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 offers scalable storage for bioengineering data. This example demonstrates how to upload a file to S3 and process it using AWS Lambda.

```py :collapsed-lines
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError

# Initialize S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def upload_to_s3(file_name, bucket, object_name=None):
    if object_name is None:
        object_name = file_name
    try:
        s3.upload_file(file_name, bucket, object_name)
        print(f"Uploaded {file_name} to {bucket}/{object_name}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("The file was not found")
    except NoCredentialsError:
        print("Credentials not available")

# Upload file
upload_to_s3('biomedical_data.csv', 'my-bioengineering-bucket', 'data/biomedical_data.csv')

# Lambda function code (to be deployed on AWS Lambda)
"""
import json
import boto3
import pandas as pd

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Download the file from S3
    s3.download_file(bucket, key, '/tmp/biomedical_data.csv')

    # Process data (example: compute mean of a column)
    data = pd.read_csv('/tmp/biomedical_data.csv')
    mean_values = data.mean().to_dict()

    # Log results
    print("Mean Values:", mean_values)

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Data processed successfully!')
    }
"""
```

This script uploads a biomedical data file to an AWS S3 bucket using the `boto3` library. The accompanying AWS Lambda function (commented out) is triggered upon file upload, downloads the file, processes it (for example, computing mean values), and logs the results. This integration automates data processing workflows, leveraging cloud scalability and serverless computing.

### Deploying a Bioinformatics Web Application on Heroku

## Ethical Considerations in Bioengineering Technology Integration

Integrating advanced technologies in bioengineering raises ethical considerations related to privacy, consent, and the potential for misuse. This section emphasizes the importance of ethical practices and provides guidelines for responsible technology integration.

### Ensuring Data Privacy and Security

Protecting sensitive biomedical data is paramount. Implementing robust encryption, access controls, and compliance with regulations like HIPAA ensures data privacy and security.

::: tip Example

Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) in a Flask application

```py :collapsed-lines title="app.py"
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from functools import wraps

app = Flask(__name__)

# Simple user roles
users = {
    'admin': {'password': 'adminpass', 'role': 'admin'},
    'user1': {'password': 'user1pass', 'role': 'user'}
}

def check_auth(username, password):
    if username in users and users[username]['password'] == password:
        return users[username]['role']
    return None

def requires_role(role):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated(*args, **kwargs):
            auth = request.authorization
            if not auth or not check_auth(auth.username, auth.password):
                return jsonify({'message': 'Authentication required'}), 401
            user_role = check_auth(auth.username, auth.password)
            if user_role != role and user_role != 'admin':
                return jsonify({'message': 'Permission denied'}), 403
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated
    return decorator

@app.route('/admin/data', methods=['GET'])
@requires_role('admin')
def admin_data():
    # Return sensitive data
    return jsonify({'data': 'Sensitive admin data'}), 200

@app.route('/user/data', methods=['GET'])
@requires_role('user')
def user_data():
    # Return user-specific data
    return jsonify({'data': 'User-specific data'}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This Flask application implements basic role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles. Only users with the 'admin' role can access admin-specific data, while regular users can access their own data.

:::

Enhancing such mechanisms with more sophisticated authentication and authorization frameworks ensures robust data privacy and security.

### Addressing Bias in Machine Learning Models

Machine learning models can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in training data. Ensuring diverse and representative datasets and implementing bias detection mechanisms are essential for fair and ethical AI applications in bioengineering.

::: tip Example

```py :collapsed-lines
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset with demographic information
data = pd.read_csv('patient_data.csv')  # Includes features and 'Outcome'

# Check for bias
print(data['Demographic'].value_counts())

# Ensure balanced dataset
X = data.drop(['Outcome', 'Demographic'], axis=1)
y = data['Outcome']
demographics = data['Demographic']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, dem_train, dem_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, demographics, test_size=0.2, stratify=demographics, random_state=42)

# Train model
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Analyze performance across demographics
for group in dem_test.unique():
    idx = dem_test == group
    print(f"Performance for {group}:")
    print(classification_report(y_test[idx], y_pred[idx]))
```

## Future Directions in Bioengineering Technology Integration

The integration of bioengineering with physical devices and language models is poised to drive significant advancements in healthcare, biotechnology, and environmental sustainability. Future directions include the development of intelligent biomedical devices, enhanced data interpretation systems, and collaborative platforms that leverage the strengths of each technology.

### Intelligent Wearables for Personalized Health Monitoring

Wearable devices embedded with intelligent algorithms and language models can provide personalized health insights and proactive healthcare management. Future developments may include continuous monitoring of vital signs, real-time health analytics, and seamless communication with healthcare providers through natural language interfaces.

::: tip Example

Integrating wearable sensor data with a chatbot for health advice

```py
import speech_recognition as sr
from transformers import pipeline

# Initialize speech recognizer and summarization pipeline
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
command_processor = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="t5-small")

def listen_for_commands():
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening for commands...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    try:
        command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"Recognized Command: {command}")
        return command
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Could not understand audio")
        return ""
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Could not request results; {e}")
        return ""

def process_command(command):
    if "open hand" in command.lower():
        action = "Opening hand"
    elif "close hand" in command.lower():
        action = "Closing hand"
    else:
        action = "Command not recognized"
    return action

def main():
    while True:
        command = listen_for_commands()
        if command:
            action = process_command(command)
            print(action)
            # Here, integrate with prosthetic control system
            # e.g., send_signal_to_prosthetic(action)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
