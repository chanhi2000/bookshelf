Building modern web applications requires a solid understanding of both frontend and backend development. ASP.NET Core MVC is a powerful framework for creating full-stack web applications with clean architecture and maintainable code. Whether you're an aspiring developer or an experienced programmer looking to expand your skills, learning how to build an ASP.NET Core MVC web app from scratch is a valuable step in mastering the .NET ecosystem.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a full-stack .NET web application using ASP.NET Core MVC. This tutorial, created by Alen Omeri, guides you through the entire development process, including setting up the project, creating models and controllers, managing a database, and integrating external libraries like Chart.js. By the end of the course, you’ll have a functional web app and a strong foundation in ASP.NET Core development.
