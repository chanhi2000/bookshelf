Are you looking to enhance your web design skills and create responsive websites more efficiently? Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, has become a favorite among developers for its flexibility and speed in building modern web layouts. One of the most practical ways to master this framework is by applying it to real-world projects.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about building a responsive product card using Tailwind CSS. This course is designed for those who already have some foundational knowledge of Tailwind but are looking to explore more intermediate concepts. By the end, you'll be able to create a fully responsive, professional-grade product card for an e-commerce site, using best practices for both desktop and mobile layouts. Rachel Johnson from Scrimba created this course.

Throughout the course, you'll dive into key Tailwind CSS features and utilities, such as:

- Modifying the Tailwind config object to customize your design system.
- Applying custom fonts, which allows you to bring unique typography to your project.
- Controlling the maximum widths of elements for responsive layouts.
- Utilizing Tailwind’s text utilities for precise control over font sizes, colors, and spacing.
- Creating gradients and beautiful backgrounds using Tailwind’s gradient utilities.
- Styling lists, building layouts with CSS Grid, and managing responsive designs with ease.
- Adding background images, transitions, and transformations to make your design interactive and visually engaging.

Each concept is broken down and explained step-by-step, making it easy to follow even if you’re newer to Tailwind. You’ll also explore how to use arbitrary values for custom styling, giving you even more creative control over your designs. By the end of this course, you’ll not only have a completed project but also a deeper understanding of how to apply Tailwind CSS in various web development scenarios, whether for personal projects or professional work.

This course is perfect for anyone looking to sharpen their skills in Tailwind CSS while building practical, real-world projects. Watch the full course [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/cG2rf7hTvsw) (1-hour watch).
