One of the most powerful tools a developer can have in their toolbox is `git rebase`. Yet it is notorious for being complex and misunderstood.

The truth is, if you understand what it *actually* does, `git rebase` is a very elegant, and straightforward tool to achieve so many different things in Git.

In previous posts, you understood [**what Git diffs are**](/freecodecamp.org/git-diff-and-patch.md), [**what a merge is**](/freecodecamp.org/the-definitive-guide-to-git-merge/what-is-a-merge-in-git.md), and [**how Git resolves merge conflicts**](/freecodecamp.org/the-definitive-guide-to-git-merge/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts.md). In this post, you will understand what Git rebase is, why it's different from merge, and how to rebase with confidence üí™üèª

## Recap

In this tutorial, you learned about `git rebase`, a super-powerful tool to rewrite history in Git. You considered a few use cases where `git rebase` can be helpful, and how to use it with one, two, or three parameters, with and without the `--onto` switch.

I hope I was able to convince you that `git rebase` is powerful ‚Äì but also that it is quite simple once you get the gist. It is a tool to "copy-paste" commits (or, more accurately, patches). And it's a useful tool to have under your belt.
