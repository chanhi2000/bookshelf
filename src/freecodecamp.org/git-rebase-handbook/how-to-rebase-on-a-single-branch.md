You can also use `git rebase` while looking at a history of a single branch.

Let's see if you can help me here.

Say I worked from <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`feature_branch_2`, and specifically edited the file <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>`code.py`. I started by changing all strings to be wrapped by double quotes rather than single quotes:

![Changing `'` into `"` in <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>`code.py`<br/><Source: [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/3VFsitGUB3s)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/06/image-273.png)

Then, I staged and committed:

```sh
git add code.py
git commit -m "Commit 17"
```

I then decided to add a new function at the beginning of the file:

![Adding the function `another_feature`<br/><Source: [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/3VFsitGUB3s)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/06/image-274.png)

Again, I staged and committed:

```sh
git add code.py
git commit -m "Commit 18"
```

And now I realized I actually forgot to change the single quotes to double quotes wrapping the `__main__` (as you might have noticed), so I did that too:

![Changing `'__main__'` into `"__main__"`<br/><Source: [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/3VFsitGUB3s)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/06/image-275.png)

Of course, I staged and committed this change:

```sh
git add code.py
git commit -m "Commit 19"
```

Now, consider the history:

![The commit history after introducing "Commit 19"<br/><Source: [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/3VFsitGUB3s)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/06/image-276.png)

It isn't really nice, is it? I mean, I have two commits that are related to one another, "Commit 17" and "Commit 19" (turning `'`s into `"`s), but they are split by the unrelated "Commit 18" (where I added a new function). What can we do? ü§î Can you help me?

Intuitively, I want to edit the history here:

![These are the commits I want to edit<br/><Source: [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/3VFsitGUB3s)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/06/image-277.png)

So, what would you do?

You are right! üëèüèª

I can rebase the history from "Commit 17" to "Commit 19", on top of "Commit 15". To do that:

```sh
git rebase --interactive --onto <SHA_OF_COMMIT_15> <SHA_OF_COMMIT_15>
```

Notice I specified "Commit 15" as the beginning of the range of commits, excluding this commit. And I didn't need to explicitly specify `HEAD` as the last parameter.

After following your advice and running the `rebase` command (thanks! üòá) I get the following screen:

![Interactive rebase<br/><Source: [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/3VFsitGUB3s)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/06/image-280.png)

So what would I do? I want to put "Commit 19" *before* "Commit 18", so it comes right after "Commit 17". I can go further and squash them together, like so:

Now when I get prompted for a commit message, I can provide the message "Commit 17+19":

And now, see our beautiful history:

Thanks again! üôåüèª
