If you've ever found yourself drowning in back-and-forth scheduling emails or confused by time zone mix-ups, you’ve probably used (or wished for) a tool like Calendly. Now you can learn how to build your own version from scratch. This course is perfect if you want to get hands-on with real full-stack development, sharpen your skills, and walk away with a polished app you can actually use or show off in your portfolio.

We just published a full-length video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channe that will teach you how to build a full-stack Calendly clone. In this project-based course, Noor Fakhry (founder of Programming Fluency) walks you through every step of building Calendra, a full-featured scheduling app with real-time Google Calendar sync, timezone handling, and polished UI.

---

## What You’ll Build

By the end of the course, you'll have a fully deployed scheduling app that can:

- Authenticate users securely with Clerk
- Let users create events and customize their availability
- Allow others to book time through a shareable link
- Automatically add events to Google Calendar
- Handle timezone logic and avoid double-booking
- Look clean, fast, and production-ready

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

In this course you will use a modern stack with real-world tools that are in-demand right now:

- **Next.js 15** (with the App Router and Server Actions)
- **React 19** (yes, the latest one)
- **TypeScript** (because maintainable code matters)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** and **shadcn/ui** for fast and beautiful styling
- **Neon** as your PostgreSQL database
- **Drizzle ORM** for clean and type-safe database queries
- **Google Calendar API** for calendar integration
- **Clerk** for seamless authentication

---

## Who This Is For

This course is made for:

- Frontend developers who want to finally get into full-stack work
- Backend-curious devs who want to explore frontend architecture
- Junior to mid-level developers looking to build a solid portfolio project
- Anyone who wants to understand how modern SaaS apps are built

You’ll get the most out of this course if you already have some experience with React and JavaScript or TypeScript. You don’t need to be a backend expert because Noor walks through everything step by step.

---
