If you've ever wanted to develop software that runs on a blockchain, now is the perfect time to learn. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced programmer, mastering blockchain development can open doors to exciting opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and algorithmic trading.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to develop smart contracts and blockchain applications using Python and Vyper—even if you have no prior programming experience. This comprehensive course covers everything from the basics of blockchain to advanced smart contract development. You'll learn to write, deploy, and interact with smart contracts while also gaining proficiency in Python scripting. Plus, you'll discover how to leverage AI tools to accelerate your development process. Patrick Collins developed this course.
