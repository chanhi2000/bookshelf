There are a few other areas that I haven't mentioned so far, but can be a good addition:

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "The React Router Cheatsheet – Everything You Need to Know",
  "desc": "If you're building React applications for the web, you're going to need to use a dedicated router to display pages and navigate your user around them.  That's why today we're going to go over the most popular and most powerful router for React applic...",

}
```

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "How to Write Unit Tests in React",
  "desc": "When you're building a website and coding all the cool features you had planned, you'll want to test if everything works as expected. Now, you can’t do that just by going through the website yourself – you need to check if each unit of your code is w...",

}
```

Additionally, you may be asked to implement a small feature using the concepts I explained in this article. This gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of React.

Also, it's helpful to have a few React projects on your resume. Check out the [Master React by Building 25 Projects](/freecodecamp.org/master-react-by-building-25-projects.md).

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "Master React by Building 25 Projects",
  "desc": "React is one of the most popular frontend JavaScript frameworks.  We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build twenty-five different projects using React. Each project is designed to challenge and e...",

}
```

Keep in mind that React is not limited to just these topics, there are additional resources in the References section. However, this handbook should serve as a useful guide before interviews. Feel free to keep re-visiting it during your interview preparation.
