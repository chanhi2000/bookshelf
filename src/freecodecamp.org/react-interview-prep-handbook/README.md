## Conclusion

In this handbook, we outlined several important topics to prepare for your next React interview. We started with a few basic concepts in React, then moved to Hooks. Then, we saw a few additional concepts that are good to know before discussing React Redux.

I have written clear and concise explanations for each topic, with examples. That should help you articulate these concepts to interviewers. At places where I couldn't explain, I have pointed to other helpful resources that explain better. This makes the article your go-to place any time during your interview prep.

During the interviews, just stay calm and confidently demonstrate your knowledge. Good communication puts a nice impression on the interview. Lastly, remember that each interview is a learning opportunity - whether you succeed or not. Stay positive and keep refining your skills. All the best in your interviews!
