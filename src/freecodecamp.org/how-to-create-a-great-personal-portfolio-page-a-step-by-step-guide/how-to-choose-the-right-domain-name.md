When setting up your personal portfolio website, selecting the perfect domain name is a crucial decision that can impact your online presence significantly.

Your domain name is essentially your online identity, so it's important to choose wisely to make a lasting impression on your visitors and potential clients.

For my personal portfolio page, I like to keep it simple: firstname+lastname.com or just firstname.com. So for me it is: [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>vaheaslanyan.com](https://vaheaslanyan.com). (My firstname + lastname.com)

## Other examples are

1. **JohnDoe.com**: This is the most direct approach, using both your first and last name. It's professional and clear for anyone looking for your work.
2. **AlexJohnson.dev**: For those in the tech industry, using a domain extension like .dev can highlight your area of expertise.
3. **MichaelRoberts.design**: Similar to the .dev extension, using .design can be a great choice for professionals in fields like graphic design, UX/UI, or related areas.
4. **Elena.co**: If your first name is unique enough, or if you prefer a shorter URL, you might use just your first name with a less common extension like .co.
5. **MaxCreates.com**: If "Max" is your nickname and you're in a creative industry, this domain clearly indicates what you do and who you are.

## Importance of a Domain Name

Your domain name is the first thing users see when they land on your website, so it should be memorable, easy to spell, and reflect your brand identity.

Here's why it's critical:

- **It Reflects Your Brand**: A well-chosen domain name can effectively convey your unique voice and what you have to offer. If it is your project portfolio website, then something that reflects your name or nickname is a great way to accomplish this.
- **It Improves Search Engine Ranking**: Having relevant keywords in your domain name can positively impact your website's SEO.
- **It Attracts Potential Clients**: A professional and catchy domain name can pique the interest of potential clients and make your website stand out.

## Tips for Choosing the Perfect Domain Name

- **Keep It Simple**: Opt for a domain name that is easy to remember and type.
- **Include Keywords**: If possible, incorporate relevant keywords related to your industry or profession.
- **Consider Your Niche**: Ensure your domain name aligns with the type of work showcased on your portfolio.
- **Avoid Numbers and Hyphens**: Numbers and hyphens can be confusing and are often forgotten when typing a domain name.
- **Check Availability**: Verify that the domain name you want is not already taken and is available for purchase. You can use [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com/), [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>godaddy.com](https://godaddy.com/nl-nl) and many other online hosting websites.
