If you want to improve your analytical skills, there's no better way to do that than solving problems.

If you are a programmer, then this is something you should do for yourself. Programmers need to deal with all sorts of problems almost every day.

Most importantly, solving problems in an efficient manner can make you much more productive. And solving challenging problems helps us do that.

### Why Should You Develop Your Problem-Solving Skills?

These days, technology is developing rapidly, and we are seeing some amazing changes and improvements almost every day.

Whenever we talk about technology, a buzzword appears in our mind – and that is coding or programming. Now, coding/programming isn't just about solving different kinds of problems using different programming languages, but it's a large part of what you'll do as a developer.

The fields of Web development, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, App Development, and many others require strong problem-solving skills.

There are many popular websites that help you do that by providing various types of problems where you need to apply your analytical and mathematical skills to solve each problem using programming languages.

I am going to provide you with a list of coding challenge websites that will help you become more advanced day by day.

Keep in mind that these websites are useful for everybody, whether you are new to coding challenges or you are a professional programmer and so on.

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/wla1ho0uoz9xuvp5iuwi.png)

HackerRank is one of the most popular coding practice websites out there. This is a nice platform for everyone, especially beginners.

The website looks nice and polished, and the users who come here the first time don't struggle when navigating throughout the website, so that is definitely a positive thing here.

![Login page](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/wr0o61pq2ngfwil3ys9d.png)

HackerRank offers different portals for companies and developers. If you are learning to solve problems, then you will choose the **For Developers** section.

If you want to learn any specific topics or programming languages, then this website is the perfect place to get started in that. You can prepare yourself by topics. You can also take their certification exam and stand out from the crowd. I have already passed their Python (Basic) certification exam.

![Prep](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/k3j4sfp9tovx9ifphf0a.png)

You can also choose preparation kits from there, and prepare yourself before your interview if you want. Moreover, you can take part in programming contests.

Here, you will also get a nice personal profile page. You can check out my profile from HackerRank <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-hackerrank"/>[here](https://hackerrank.com/FahimFBA).

![Codeforces Banner](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/8wtc4xnpohe9yr6j2eij.png)

Codeforces is one of the most used and well-known coding challenge and practice websites in the world, and it is sponsored by Telegram. Especially if you know about CP (Competitive Programming), then there is a high chance you have heard a lot about this website.

Although the website might look a little bit different to newcomers, you won't need much time to get used to it. You can train yourself by solving problems of different categories, difficulty levels, and so on.

Competitive programmers have ranks based on their successful results in programming contests. If you have heard about the **RED** coder / **PURPLE** coder, etc, then it is definitely from Codeforces.

![Codeforces Ranking System](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/17fansawmwowcvhyc639.png)

You can get the idea of the ranking system on Codeforces from the image above. For more details, you can check out [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>this blog entry](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/68288).

Codeforces arranges contests regularly each week, and they are categorized into div 1, div 2, div 3 and div 4. They also arrange global round and educational round contests. You can get the timeline of the contests directly from [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>here](https://codeforces.com/contests).

Codeforces also provides a nice user profile on their website. You can check mine [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>here](https://codeforces.com/profile/FahimFBA) as well.

### 4. LeetCode

<SiteInfo
  name="LeetCode - The World's Leading Online Programming Learning Platform"
  desc="Level up your coding skills and quickly land a job. This is the best place to expand your knowledge and get prepared for your next interview."
  url="https://leetcode.com/"
  logo="https://leetcode.com/favicon-192x192.png"
  preview="https://leetcode.com/static/images/LeetCode_Sharing.png"/>

![Leetcode banner](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/jk9l09bi3ku5d0op2x7j.png)

If you are familiar with the **FAANG** (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) buzzword, then you should definitely know about this website! If you want to practice for your coding interview for the big giant tech companies like FAANG, then they all do **leetcoding**.

You might think that I have made a typo in the above paragraph. No, I didn't. LeetCode has become this popular among people who target FAANG and those who are working on their problem solving skills. Taking part in contests on LeetCode has become common, and people call it leetcoding!

Here, you can solve a lot of problems, and filter the problems by the lists, difficulty levels, status, and tags.

![LeetCode ProblemSet1](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/tphf8k817fbz0vsge9d3.png)

You can also choose problems regarding Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Dynamic Programming, and many other categories.

![LeetCode ProblemSet2](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/0y0ov1fxzvxwiv5bglri.png)

As I mentioned above, you can also take part in programming contests. The only thing that makes LeetCode different is that it is based on Algorithm practice. Yeah, LeetCode is not like any other coding website, because it focuses on algorithm practice alone.

You do not need to provide the full code for solving a problem here, you just need to crack the solution by providing a valid algorithm using any popular language that can solve the problem.

You also get to see how your code performs among others, how much space and time it takes, and so on.

Most importantly, LeetCode has an amazing discussion group where people talk about their problems, solutions, how to improve their algorithms, how to improve the efficiency of their code, and so on. This is one of the most powerful features of LeetCode.

One sad part about LeetCode is that you will not get every feature for free! Yeah, it's true. You have to pay for it monthly or yearly to unlock all its features. There are a lot of problems you will find locked on the website. You can not unlock them if you do not purchase the premium plan.

![LeetCode pricing](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/tvww5ogj3eq5qw23ss8m.png)

If you are just starting your algorithm journey on LeetCode, then actually you don't need to worry about their premium plans as the free version will be more than enough for you.

Later, if you want to become more serious, then paying for their premium subscription will be a big deal actually as you'll get a ton more features. This is very much helpful, and includes things like top interview questions, top FAANG questions, video explanations, and more.

You also get a nice profile page on LeetCode. You can check out mine [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>here](https://leetcode.com/FBA/).

![Online Judge banner image](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2022/06/fat4pnmszr5xo5yqus73.png)

This is one of the oldest websites out there for solving programming-related problems. I still find it to be a very hard website for beginners. The UI and navigation of the website are also very old.

All of the questions come with a PDF here. You need to download the PDF file of the problem if you want to solve problems as they do not offer a direct preview of the questions.

They have a lot of problemsets on their [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>website](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8). I still find a lot of users using this website nowadays. Therefore, I mentioned it here.

## Personal Opinion

If you are a complete beginner, then start with [beecrowd](#1beecrowdformerlyuri). If you want to start problem solving along with learning a specific programming language, then start with [HackerRank](#2-hackerrank-2).

After solving almost 50+ problems on beecrowd or HackerRank, start solving problems on [Codeforces](#3-codeforces-1). The first time, you won't be able to do that well in the programming contests on Codeforces, and that is completely okay – it is natural. You just need to try regularly. The questions might seem pretty hard to you, but it'll become easier day by day after solving problems continuously.

You can participate in [AtCoder](#7atcoder) the day you start solving problems on Codeforces. You can also try [CodeChef](#6-codechef-1), but I find Codeforces is enough in this case.

This will prepare you for the [ICPC](#21icpcinternationalcollegiateprogrammingcontest) and [Code Jam](#20-code-jam-googles-coding-competitions-1). Don't forget to solve the earlier questions on Code Jam.

If you want to gain expertise in Data Science, then simply go for [Kaggle](#5-kaggle-1).

If you want to gain expertise in Algorithms, then [LeetCode](#4leetcode), and [LightOJ](#16lightoj) are your only places. [GeeksforGeeoks](#14-geeksforgeeks-popularly-known-as-gfg-1) will also help you in this aspect.

For LeetCode, get some help from [Nick White (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"/>`nicholaswwhite`)](https://x.com/nicholaswwhite). His [LeetCode Solution](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU_sdQYzUj2keVENTP0a5rdykRSgg9Wp-) playlist has 189 videos as of today, and you will learn a lot from him, trust me!

Another good resource is [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/) where you can get curated problems and their solutions from LeetCode. The official [YouTube channel of <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>`@Neetcode`](https://youtube.com/@NeetCode) is also a great channel.
