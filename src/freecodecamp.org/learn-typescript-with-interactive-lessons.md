TypeScript can make your life easier as a programmer and make your code less error-prone.

We just posted a TypeScript course for beginners on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Bob Ziroll from Scrimba teaches this course. Interactive code is available on the Scrimba course page for each lesson.

The course will give you a hands-on introduction to TypeScript. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of TypeScript and how to leverage it to create safer and more reliable JavaScript applications.

TypeScript is a "superset" of JavaScript, meaning all valid JavaScript code is also valid in TypeScript. However, TypeScript enhances your coding experience by enabling you to write code with greater confidence in the stability and longevity of your projects. This is done via compile-time checking, which identifies potential bugs before running the code, allowing you to fix issues proactively and prevent crashes in your programs. This ensures a smoother and more reliable development process.

By providing a strong typing system and modern tooling support, TypeScript also provides a robust development environment. This makes it easier to refactor code, manage large codebases, and collaborate with other developers. This introductory course will equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively integrate TypeScript into your JavaScript projects.

Here are the topics covered in the course:

- Why TypeScript?
- Basic types
- Literal types
- Custom types (objects)
- Typed arrays
- Optional properties
- Unions
- Type narrowing
- Utility types
- Generics
