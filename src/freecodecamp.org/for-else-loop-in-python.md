Python supports the for-else loop construct that is lesser known but super helpful.

If youâ€™ve programmed in Python, you may have used the `for` loop to iterate over items in iterables such as lists. But for some use cases, using the for loop in conjunction with the `else` clause can be helpful.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll learn how to use for-else loops by coding a couple of examples to understand how they work.

## Syntax of the `for-else` Loop in Python

In Python, the `for-else` loop is a construct that combines a `for` loop with an `else` clause.

The loop body typically checks for a condition. If the condition is `True`, the control breaks out of the loop. The `else` block will execute only when the `for` loop completes normally without encountering a `break` statement.

Let's look at a generic `for-else` loop construct:

```py
for item in iterable:
    # loop body
    if condition:
        break
else:
    # else body
```

Here's a breakdown of how this works:

- The `for` loop iterates over each item in the `iterable`.
- If the `condition` is `True` and the control breaks out of the loop, the `else` block is skipped.
- If the `for` loop iterates over all items in the `iterable`â€”without meeting the condition to break out of the loopâ€”the `else` block is executed.

Now let's code a couple of examples.

## Example 1: Finding a Prime Number

Let's use the `for-else` loop to check if a number is prime. As you may recall, a number is prime if it is divisible only by 1 and itself and has no other factors.

Look at the code snippet below:

```py
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False

    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n))+ 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            print(f"{n} is divisible by {i}. Not a prime number.")
            break
    else:
        # This block executes if the loop did not encounter a break statement
        print(f"{n} is a prime number.")
        return True
```

Here, the `is_prime()` function first checks if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it returns `False` since prime numbers are greater than 1. Remember, the smallest prime number is 2. We use the `for` loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).

- If `n` is divisible by any `i` in this range (2, `âˆšn`), it means `n` is not a prime number, as we've found a factor. The function prints a message and breaks out of the loop. And the `else` block is skipped.
- If the loop completes without finding any factorsâ€”without hitting a `break` statementâ€”the `else` block executes. The function prints that `n` is a prime number and returns `True`.

You can verify that the `is_prime()` function works as expected with a few function calls:

```py
# Test with a non-prime number
is_prime(10) 
# Output: 10 is divisible by 2. Not a prime number.


# Test with a prime number
is_prime(13) 
# Output: 13 is a prime number.
```

::: note A Note on Checking for Prime Numbers

Youâ€™d probably run the loop over all the numbers from 2 to `n` to check if thereâ€™s a factor. But it actually suffices to iterate up to the **square root of `n`**. Why?

Recall that if `p` is a factor, you can always find a `q` such that `p x q = n`:

- If `n` is a perfect square, then `p = q`.
- If `n` is not a perfect square, you have the following. If `p` is less than `âˆšn`, `q` is greater than `âˆšn`. And if `q` is greater than `âˆšn`, `p` is less than `âˆšn`.

ðŸ’¡ So if you don't find a factor up to `âˆšn`, you cannot find one beyond `âˆšn` either.

## Example 2: Searching for an Item in a List

Let's take another example where the `for-else` loop is helpful.

The following `search item()` function takes in a list and an item. The goal is to loop over the items in the list and check if the item exists. For this problem you can use the for-else loop construct like so:

```py
def search_item(lst, item):
    for i in lst:
        if i == item:
            print(f"Found {item} in the list.")
            break
    else:
        print(f"{item} is not in the list.")
```

If the `item` is found the control breaks out of the loop. The `else` block is triggered only if the item is not found in the list.

Letâ€™s verify with a few calls to the function:

```py
# Test with a list containing the item
search_item([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)  
# Output: Found 3 in the list.

# Test with a list not containing the item
search_item([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)  
# Output: 6 is not in the list.
```

## Wrapping Up

I hope you found this tutorial on the `for-else` loop construct in Python helpful.

This can come in handy especially when exiting the loop after iterating over all itemsâ€”without breaking out of the loop earlierâ€”is of interest. That said, if you don't need to conditionally break out of the loop, you don't need a `for-else` loop, and a simple `for` loop will suffice.

Keep coding. Until the next tutorial!
