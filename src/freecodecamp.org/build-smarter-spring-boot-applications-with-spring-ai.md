If you're a Java developer working with Spring Boot, you might wonder how to harness the power of AI in your projects. The good news is that Spring AI, an emerging tool within the Spring ecosystem, offers seamless AI integrations that are both accessible and robust. Whether you want to add natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, generate images on the fly, or transcribe audio, Spring AI provides the tools to make it happen.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about integrating AI capabilities into your Spring Boot applications using **Spring AI**. Developed by Faisal Memon, this hands-on course goes beyond theory, guiding you through practical projects that showcase the real-world potential of AI in application development. By the end of the course, you'll have built a variety of projects that combine AI creativity and productivity, giving you a solid foundation in leveraging AI technologies with Spring Boot.

## What You'll Build

The course is structured around two key projects, designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of how to apply AI in different contexts:

1. **Project 1: Stock Photo Generator, Q&A Bot, and Recipe Generator**
    - This project blends creativity and utility by exploring three different AI-driven tools:
      - **Stock Photo Generator**: Generate high-quality images using AI.
      - **Q&A Bot**: Build a chatbot capable of answering questions based on user input.
      - **Recipe Generator**: Create a tool that suggests recipes based on ingredients, powered by machine learning.
2. **Project 2: Audio Transcriber**
    - Develop a transcription tool that converts spoken words into written text. This project demonstrates how to incorporate state-of-the-art speech recognition and processing technologies within a Spring Boot application.

## Course Outline

This course is packed with detailed tutorials and step-by-step guidance. Here are the key topics and sections you’ll cover:

1. **Introduction to Spring AI** and understanding the core concepts.
2. **Setting Up Projects** with proper configurations and dependencies.
3. **Integrating OpenAI APIs** for NLP and image generation.
4. **Building Services and Controllers** for chat and image generation features.
5. **Parameterizing and Customizing Outputs** to enhance functionality.
6. **Creating a React Frontend** to interact with your Spring Boot backend.
7. **Handling CORS Issues** and other common development challenges.
8. **Developing the Audio Transcriber Tool** with end-to-end integration.
9. **Styling Your Applications** with CSS and frontend best practices.

## Why Learn Spring AI?

Spring AI offers a streamlined way to integrate AI into your Java applications without reinventing the wheel. It provides standardized ways to access powerful AI models (like OpenAI’s GPT and image generation APIs) within familiar Spring Boot paradigms. This means you can leverage your existing Spring skills while unlocking new AI-driven possibilities. From chatbots to image generation and transcription tools, the potential applications are vast and relevant to modern software development needs.

If you’re ready to level up your Spring Boot applications with cutting-edge AI features, head over to the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/9Crrhz0pm8s) and watch this course (5-hour watch).
