APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of modern software applications, enabling seamless communication between different systems and services. However, this interconnectedness also makes them a prime target for cyberattacks. API breaches have led to the exposure of millions of records, making API security a top priority for developers, security professionals, and organizations worldwide. Understanding how attackers exploit API vulnerabilities, and how to defend against them, is essential for anyone working in software development or cybersecurity.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about **API Security Fundamentals**. This course, taught by cybersecurity expert **Dan Barahona**, covers the core threats to APIs and how to prevent breaches. You'll learn about the **OWASP API Security Top 10**, analyze real-world API attacks, and explore the **3 Pillars of API Security** to build a strong defense against threats. Whether you're a developer, security professional, or IT leader, this course will give you the essential knowledge to safeguard APIs effectively.

Here are the topics you will learn about in this course:

- **Introduction to API Security** – Discover why APIs have become a top target for cyberattacks and the risks they pose to businesses and users.
- **Anatomy of Real-World API Breaches** – Examine real API breaches, how attackers exploited vulnerabilities, and what could have prevented them.
- **OWASP API Security Top 10** – Understand the most critical API security risks identified by OWASP (updated in 2023) and how to mitigate them.
- **The 3 Pillars of API Security** – Learn the key components of a strong API security strategy: **Governance, Testing, and Monitoring**.
- **API Security Technology Landscape** – Explore different security technologies, their capabilities, and the gaps they leave behind.
- **Conclusion and Best Practices** – Wrap up with key takeaways, best practices, and practical security recommendations for developers and security teams.

If you're looking to **strengthen your API security knowledge** and learn from an industry expert, this course is for you. Check it out on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/R-4_DbV1Su4) (2-hour watch).
