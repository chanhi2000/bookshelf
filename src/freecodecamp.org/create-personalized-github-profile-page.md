Have you ever wanted to spruce up your GitHub profile page and make it stand out? Well, you're in luck!

With just a few simple steps, you can create a personalized GitHub profile that showcases your skills, projects, and personality. Let's dive in.

## Create A New Repository

Go to [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>GitHub](https://github.com) and click on the "New" button to create a new repository.

![button to create new repository](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/04/github_new.png)

---

## Setup Your Repository

You should see a new page where you can create the new repo and it should look something like this:

![new repository form page](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/04/new_repo_page.png)

Make sure the name of the repository is the same as your GitHub username, otherwise this won't work.

![after filling the details](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/04/special_note.png)

You can see that after entering your username, there's a new note showing right below the repository name field that says, "this will create a special repository that you can use to add a <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-markdown"/>`README.md` to your GitHub profile. Make sure it‚Äôs public and initialize it with a README to get started."

The error for the repository name is showing because I already have my profile, you won't face this issue.

So, lets do this. First, keep the GitHub repository public and not private.

Then click on the add a README file checkbox so that after creating the repository, GitHub will automatically add a README file to that repository.

Next, click the "Create repository" button.

After successfully creating the repository, you should be redirected to the repository page, and you should see the <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-markdown"/>`README.md` file.

## Add ReadMe Content

Now, click on the "Edit README" button that should be on the right side of the page

Paste the following text into your <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-markdown"/>`README.md` file

```md :collapsed-lines title="README.md"

In the above content, there are three places where you need to add your username:

- The first one is in the first line: put your name instead of `<YOUR NAME>`
- In the second statement, there are two places where you should put your username instead of `<username>`
- In the tech stack section I have added very few tech stacks just for this tutorial but you can add even more by adding the names of the tech. Head over to their [docs to learn more about adding other icons (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`tandpfun/skill-icons`)](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons?tab=readme-ov-file#example).

Also, modify all the other fields according to your needs, all the information is personal so you have to edit most of the information. I have given my information here, so that you'll just need to fill up your details and get an updated profile pretty fast.

That's it. Click on "Commit changes" and you should have a great looking GitHub profile page.

Head over to your Profile page by replacing your username in the following URL `https://github.com/<username>` and you should see your updated GitHub profile page.
