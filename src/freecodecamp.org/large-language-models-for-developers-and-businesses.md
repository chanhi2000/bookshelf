Language learning models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly, reshaping AI in various industries. In this article, we’ll go over five LLMs that are currently making an impact with their advanced features and wide-ranging use cases.

## LLM Basics

Before looking at each model, let’s go over some important LLM concepts that you should be familiar with:

### Parameter Count

Parameters are the building blocks of machine learning models, and you can adjust them during training to improve predictions.

The number of parameters tells us how complex and capable the model is. LLMs with more parameters (from 70 billion to over 1 trillion) are better at understanding context, generating detailed text, and handling complex tasks. But larger models need more computational power to run.

### Training Data

The success of an LLM depends on the quality and how up-to-date its training data is. These models are trained on huge amounts of data from books, websites, and many other sources. If the data is outdated, models may give older information.

Newer techniques, like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), help by pulling in real-time data. We’ll discuss more details about each model’s data and how RAG improves them below.

### Applications

LLMs are used for many tasks, like content creation, answering questions, coding help, and giving personalized recommendations.

Some models are better for specific tasks—for instance, some excel at creative writing, while others handle technical work more effectively. We will explore how each model performs in different areas.

## What to Consider When Choosing an LLM

When you’re deciding which LLM to use, keep these key factors in mind:

- **Parameter Size vs. Power Needs:** You need to balance the number of parameters with the power needed to run the model. A model with too many parameters may require expensive hardware and more energy, while a smaller one might not perform well enough.
- **Fine-Tuning:** To get the best results, you may need to fine-tune the model by training it on your own data or adjusting how it responds. For example, if you want it to handle customer support, you could fine-tune it using a set of frequently asked questions relevant to your business.
- **Accuracy:** You can measure a model’s accuracy through testing, benchmarks, or comparing it against standard metrics. It is important to check how well the model has been tested on tasks similar to yours to understand its strengths and weaknesses.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Think about the cost of training and using the model, including the hardware and operational costs.
- **Ethics and Safety:** Check if the model includes protections against harmful or biased outputs, which is becoming more important in AI development.

## Overview of Popular LLMs

Now it’s time to dive into the LLMs that I think are making the biggest impact right now:

### <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-openai"/>GPT-4

OpenAI's GPT-4 is still one of the most powerful models available. It's known for its creativity and accuracy in many different applications. With over a trillion parameters, GPT-4 is great at natural conversations, answering complex questions, and generating creative content.

Many businesses use it for customer support, automation, and content creation, while developers use it for coding help. But its context window is smaller compared to newer models, maxing out at 32k tokens.

::: tabs

@tab Details

- **Size:** Over 1 trillion parameters
- **Training Data:** 45 terabytes of quality text (up to 2023)
- **Accuracy:** Over 90% in conversation tests
- **Learning Speed:** Fast adaptation
- **Applications:** Used in customer support, automation, content creation, and coding assistance

@tab Training Data Consideration

 GPT-4's data goes up to 2023, so it might miss the latest information. Adding real-time data retrieval (RAG) can help it stay up-to-date.

@tab Things to Consider

- **Parameter Size vs. Power Needs:** It needs a lot of power due to its size.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Can be easily adjusted for different tasks.
- **Accuracy:** Very accurate in conversations.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Expensive to run because of its size.
- **Ethics:** Includes safety measures but is still being improved.

@tab Details

- **Size:** 500 billion parameters
- **Training Data:** 30 terabytes, including text, images, and structured data (up to 2024)
- **Learning Speed:** 40% faster than similar models
- **Applications:** Best for creative projects and complex problem-solving.

@tab Training Data Consideration Gemini’s data is current up to 2024, but real-time data retrieval (RAG) can help keep it updated.

@tab Things to Consider

- **Parameter Size vs. Power Needs:** Requires a lot of power, but slightly less than GPT-4.    
- **Fine-Tuning:** Very flexible for different tasks.
- **Accuracy:** Highly accurate, though it varies by task.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Offers good performance at a reasonable cost.
- **Ethics:** Focused on responsible use, but ongoing updates are needed.
