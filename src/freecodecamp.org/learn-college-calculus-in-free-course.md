Calculus concepts are important to understand for many types of software development.

Calculus is often used when developing algorithms for modeling real-word phenomena. It is also used in graphics and physics simulations, which are key parts to many video games. Calculus is also used in the field of machine learning.

We have posted a 12-hour [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>college Calculus course](https://youtu.be/HfACrKJ_Y2w) on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

This course was created by Dr. Linda Green who teaches at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She has years of experience teaching Calculus to undergraduate students.

This course actually combines two courses taught by Dr. Green. She teaches both Calculus 1 and a Calculus 1 Corequisite course, designed to be taken at the same time.

In this video, the lectures from the Corquisite course, which review important Algebra and Trigonometry concepts, have been interspersed with the Calculus 1 lectures at the places suggested by Dr. Green.

Below are all the Calculus concepts you will learn about in this course. The sections from the Corequisite course are identified.

- \[Corequisite\] Rational Expressions
- \[Corequisite\] Difference Quotient
- Graphs and Limits
- When Limits Fail to Exist
- Limit Laws
- The Squeeze Theorem
- Limits using Algebraic Tricks
- When the Limit of the Denominator is 0
- \[Corequisite\] Lines: Graphs and Equations

We recommend you pull out some paper and a pencil and take physical notes – just like when you were back in a classroom.

This manual process of taking notes will help you better comprehend and retain these concepts, since Dr. Green moves fast and covers a lot of topics in a short time.
