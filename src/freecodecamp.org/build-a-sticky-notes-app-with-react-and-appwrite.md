## Course Features

The frontend of our notes application is built using React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows you to create dynamic and responsive web applications with ease. In this course, you will learn how to leverage React’s component-based architecture to build interactive and efficient user interfaces.

On the backend, you will utilize Appwrite, an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that simplifies backend development. Appwrite provides a range of backend services such as databases, authentication, and storage, allowing you to focus on building your application without worrying about infrastructure management.

Here are some key features of the application:

### 1. Production Database

- All note data is stored on a live production-ready database provided by Appwrite. This ensures your notes are securely saved and easily accessible from anywhere

### 2. Draggable Notes

- Implement draggable notes functionality that allows users to drag and drop notes anywhere on the screen. This feature enhances the user experience by offering flexibility in organizing notes

### Autosave Changes

- Changes to note content and position are automatically saved. This feature ensures that users don’t lose any changes and eliminates the need for manual saving

### 4. Color Picker

- Add a color picker that enables users to change note colors at any time. This customization feature allows users to visually distinguish and organize their notes better

## Conclusion

By the end of this course, you will have a fully functional notes application that you can use personally or showcase as a part of your portfolio. Additionally, you will gain valuable experience in working with React and Appwrite, equipping you with the skills to tackle other fullstack projects.
