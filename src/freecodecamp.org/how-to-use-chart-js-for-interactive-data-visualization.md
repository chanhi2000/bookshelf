## How to Get Started with Chart.js

Creating interactive and visually appealing charts is straightforward thanks to Chart.js. In this section, I'll walk you through the initial steps to get Chart.js up and running in your project, including setting up the library and creating your first chart.

### Set Up Your Project

To get started with Chart.js, you need to include the library in your project. You can do this by either downloading the Chart.js library or linking to it via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Using a CDN is often the easiest way to get started.

#### Include Chart.js via CDN

Add the following `<script>` tag to the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Chart.js Example</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Chart container -->
    <canvas id="myChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>

    <!-- Your JavaScript code will go here -->

</body>
</html>
```

### Create Your First Chart

Next, you need to create a `<canvas>` element in your HTML file where the chart will be rendered. This element acts as a container for the chart. In the example above, we already added a `<canvas>` element with the `id` of `myChart`.

### Write the JavaScript Code

Now, let's write some JavaScript to create a basic chart. Place the following script in the `<body>` section of your HTML file, below the `<canvas>` element, or in an external JavaScript file:

```html
<script>
    // Get the context of the canvas element we want to select
    var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');

    // Create a new Chart object
    var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'bar', // The type of chart we want to create
        data: {
            labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'], // Labels for the chart
            datasets: [{
                label: 'Votes',
                data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3], // Data points for the chart
                backgroundColor: [
                    'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                    'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
                ],
                borderColor: [
                    'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                    'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                    'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                    'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                    'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                    'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
                ],
                borderWidth: 1
            }]
        },
        options: {
            scales: {
                y: {
                    beginAtZero: true // Start the y-axis at 0
                }
            }
        }
    });
</script>
```

Alright, let's understand what's going on in this code:

1. **Get the Canvas Context**: The first line of the script selects the `<canvas>` element by its `id` and gets its 2D drawing context. This context is necessary for creating the chart.

```js
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
```

2. **Create a New Chart**: The `Chart` constructor creates a new chart. You need to pass two arguments: the context and a configuration object.

```js
 var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
     type: 'bar', // The type of chart we want to create
```

3. **Data Object**: The `data` property of the configuration object defines the chart's data and labels. In this example, we use an array of colors as labels and an array of numbers as data points.

```js
 data: {
     labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
     datasets: [{
         label: 'Votes',
         data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
```

4. **Styling**: The `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` properties specify the colors for the bars and their borders. The `borderWidth` sets the width of the borders.

```js
 backgroundColor: [
     'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
     'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
     'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
     'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
     'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
     'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
 ],
 borderColor: [
     'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
     'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
     'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
     'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
     'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
     'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
 ],
 borderWidth: 1
```

5. **Options Object**: The `options` property contains configuration options for the chart. In this example, we set the `beginAtZero` option to `true` to start the y-axis at 0.

```js
 options: {
     scales: {
         y: {
             beginAtZero: true
         }
     }
 }
```

### View Your Chart

### 1. Line Chart

A line chart is used to show trends over time or to demonstrate continuous data. It's effective for displaying data that changes continuously over a period. Here's an example of a simple line chart:

```js
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
    var lineChart = new Chart(ctx, {
      type: 'line',
      data: {
        labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June'],
        datasets: [{
          label: 'Sales',
          data: [30, 45, 60, 35, 50, 40],
          borderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
          borderWidth: 2,
          fill: false
        }]
      },
      options: {
        scales: {
          y: {
            beginAtZero: true
          }
        }
      }
    });
```

### 2. Bar Chart

A bar chart is used to compare different categories of data. It's ideal for showing discrete data points and comparing magnitudes between categories. Here's how you can create one:

```js
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var barChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Votes',
            data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
            backgroundColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
            ],
            borderColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
            ],
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            y: {
                beginAtZero: true
            }

### 5. Scatter Charts

A scatter chart is used to display relationships between two or more variables. It's effective for showing correlations and distributions of data points.

```js
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var scatterChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'scatter',
    data: {
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Scatter Dataset',
            data: [
                { x: 10, y: 20 },
                { x: 15, y: 25 },
                { x: 7, y: 10 },
                { x: 12, y: 18 },
                { x: 20, y: 30 }
            ],
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.5)',
            borderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            x: {
                type: 'linear', // Scatter charts support only 'linear' scale type for x-axis
                position: 'bottom'
            },
            y: {
                type: 'linear', // Scatter charts support only 'linear' scale type for y-axis
                position: 'left'
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### 6. Bubble Charts

A bubble chart is similar to a scatter chart but uses bubble-like markers to represent data points. It's useful for comparing relationships between variables and showing data distribution with sizes of bubbles.

```js
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var bubbleChart = new Chart(ctx, {

    data: {
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Bubble Dataset',
            data: [

                position: 'left'
            }
        }
    }
});

### 7. Radar Chart

A radar chart (or spider chart) is used to display multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point. Here's how you can create one:

```js
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var radarChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'radar',
    data: {
        labels: ['Math', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'English', 'History'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Student A',
            data: [85, 90, 75, 80, 70, 85],
            fill: true,
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
            pointBackgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
            pointBorderColor: '#fff',
            pointHoverBackgroundColor: '#fff',
            pointHoverBorderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
            borderWidth: 1
        }, {
            label: 'Student B',
            data: [70, 85, 80, 75, 85, 90],
            fill: true,
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
            pointBackgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
            pointBorderColor: '#fff',
            pointHoverBackgroundColor: '#fff',
            pointHoverBorderColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            r: {
                suggestedMin: 0,
                suggestedMax: 100
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### 8. Polar Area Chart

A polar area chart is similar to a pie chart, but the sectors are equal angles and differ in how far they extend from the center of the circle. It's useful for showing data distributions with the proportion of each category.

```js
var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
var polarAreaChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'polarArea',
    data: {
        labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Votes',
            data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
            backgroundColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.5)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.5)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.5)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.5)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.5)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.5)'
            ],
            borderColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
            ],
            borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
            r: {
                suggestedMin: 0,
                suggestedMax: 20
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## Customization and Interactivity in Chart.js

Chart.js offers extensive options for customizing the appearance and interactivity of your charts. This section covers customizing chart appearance, adding tooltips and legends, and making charts interactive with features like zooming and hovering.

### Customizing Chart Appearance

Customizing the appearance of your charts helps make them more visually appealing and tailored to your specific needs. You can customize colors, fonts, borders, and other properties.

```js
var customChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
        labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Votes',
            data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
            backgroundColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.8)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.8)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.8)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.8)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.8)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.8)'
            ],
            borderColor: [
                'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
            ],
            borderWidth: 2
        }]
    },
    options: {
        plugins: {
            legend: {
                display: true,
                labels: {
                    color: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
                    font: {
                        size: 16,
                        family: "'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif"
                    }
                }
            },
            tooltip: {
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)',
                titleFont: {
                    size: 18
                },
                bodyFont: {
                    size: 14
                },
                callbacks: {
                    label: function(context) {
                        return context.dataset.label + ': ' + context.raw + ' votes';
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        scales: {
            x: {
                ticks: {
                    color: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                    font: {
                        size: 14
                    }
                }
            },
            y: {
                ticks: {
                    color: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                    font: {
                        size: 14
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

In this example:

- **Chart Type:** The chart is defined as a `bar` chart.
- **Background and Border Colors:** The `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` arrays are customized for each bar. For example, the "Red" bar is colored with a semi-transparent background (`rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.8)`) and a solid border (`rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)`).
- **Font and Color for Legends:** The `legend` configuration customizes the display of the chart’s legend, where the font size is set to 16, and the font family is `'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif'`. Additionally, the text color of the legend labels is customized to `rgb(255, 99, 132)`.
- **Font and Color for Axes:** The `scales` section customizes the appearance of both the X and Y axes. The font size for axis labels is set to 14, and their color is `rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)`.

### Adding Tooltips and Legends

Tooltips provide additional information when you hover over chart elements. Legends help users understand the data by showing which dataset each color represents. Both can be customized extensively, like this for example:

```js
var chartWithTooltipsAndLegend = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Sales',
            data: [30, 45, 60, 35, 50, 40],
            borderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
            borderWidth: 2,
            fill: false
        }]
    },
    options: {
        plugins: {
            legend: {
                display: true,
                position: 'top',
                labels: {
                    font: {
                        size: 14
                    }
                }
            },
            tooltip: {
                enabled: true,
                callbacks: {
                    label: function(tooltipItem) {
                        return 'Sales: $' + tooltipItem.raw;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

In this example:

- **Tooltips:** Tooltips appear when the user hovers over elements of the chart. The tooltip background is customized to be black (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`) with font sizes for both the title (18) and body text (14). The content of the tooltip is dynamically generated by a `callback` function, which appends the word "votes" to the dataset value.
- **Legends:** The legends describe the data on the chart and are placed at the top. The customization here includes setting the font size to 14 and making the legend displayable by configuring `display: true`.

### Making Charts Interactive (Zooming, Hovering, and so on)

Adding interactivity to your charts can enhance the user experience. Features like zooming, panning, and custom hover effects can be implemented using additional Chart.js plugins such as `chartjs-plugin-zoom`.

First, include the zoom plugin in your project:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chartjs-plugin-zoom@1.0.0"></script>
```

Then, configure your chart to enable zooming and panning:

```js
var interactiveChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June'],
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Sales',
            data: [30, 45, 60, 35, 50, 40],
            borderColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
            borderWidth: 2,
            fill: false
        }]
    },
    options: {
        plugins: {
            zoom: {
                pan: {
                    enabled: true,
                    mode: 'xy'
                },
                zoom: {
                    enabled: true,
                    mode: 'xy'
                }
            }
        },
        hover: {
            mode: 'nearest',
            intersect: true
        }
    }
});
```

In this example:

- **Zoom and Pan**: The `chartjs-plugin-zoom` plugin is used to add zooming and panning capabilities. Users can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or pan by dragging.
- **Hover Mode**: The `hover` option is set to `nearest`, ensuring the nearest data point is highlighted when hovered over.

## How to Work with Data in Chart.js

Chart.js provides versatile capabilities for handling data, accommodating various formats and requirements for data visualization:

### Data Formats Supported by Chart.js

Chart.js provides flexible support for various data formats to accommodate different data structures and needs:

- **Arrays**: Simple arrays of values are the most basic format and can be directly used to plot data points.

```js
  const data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
```

- **Objects**: Arrays of objects are useful for more complex data where each object represents a data point with multiple properties.

```js
  const data = [
      { x: 10, y: 20 },
      { x: 15, y: 25 },
      { x: 20, y: 30 }
  ];
```

- **JSON**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is ideal for structured data interchange, allowing for clear organization of labels and datasets.

```json
  {
      "labels": ["January", "February", "March", "April"],
      "datasets": [{
          "label": "Sales",
          "data": [10, 20, 30, 40]
      }]
  }
```

- **CSV**: Comma-Separated Values (CSV) are commonly used for tabular data and can be parsed into arrays or objects for Chart.js.

### How to Load Data from External Files (JSON, CSV)

Loading data from external files is essential for handling dynamic or large datasets efficiently:

- **Loading JSON Data**: Use the `fetch` API to retrieve JSON data and integrate it into Chart.js.

```html
  <script>
      fetch('data.json')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => {
              const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
              new Chart(ctx, {
                  type: 'bar',
                  data: data,
                  options: {}
              });
          });
  </script>
```

- **Loading CSV Data**: Utilize libraries like PapaParse to parse CSV files into usable data formats for Chart.js visualization.

```html
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/PapaParse/5.3.0/papaparse.min.js"></script>
  <script>
      Papa.parse('data.csv', {
          download: true,
          header: true,
          complete: function(results) {
              const labels = results.data.map(row => row['Month']);
              const data = results.data.map(row => parseFloat(row['Sales']));

              const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
              new Chart(ctx, {
                  type: 'line',
                  data: {
                      labels: labels,
                      datasets: [{
                          label: 'Sales',
                          data: data
                      }]
                  },
                  options: {}
              });
          }
      });
  </script>
```

### Dynamic Data Updates

Chart.js supports dynamic data updates, which is crucial for real-time data visualization:

- **Updating Data Dynamically**: Use Chart.js methods to update chart data dynamically and re-render the chart as needed.

```html
  <script>
      const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
      const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
          type: 'bar',
          data: {
              labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April'],
              datasets: [{
                  label: 'Sales',
                  data: [10, 20, 30, 40]
              }]
          },
          options: {}
      });

      // Example function to update the chart data
      function updateChartData() {
          myChart.data.datasets[0].data = [50, 60, 70, 80];
          myChart.update();
      }

      // Call the update function after 2 seconds
      setTimeout(updateChartData, 2000);
  </script>
```



In this section, we've explored the various data formats supported by Chart.js, methods for loading data from external files such as JSON and CSV, and how to implement dynamic data updates for real-time visualization. These features make Chart.js a powerful tool for interactive data visualization in web applications.

## Best Practices for Chart Design

Effective chart design ensures that your data is presented clearly and accurately, making it easy for users to understand and interpret. Here are some best practices to consider:

### Choose the Right Chart Type

Selecting the appropriate chart type is crucial for conveying your data effectively:

- **Bar Charts**: Ideal for comparing different categories or tracking changes over time. Use bar charts when you have discrete data points.

```js
  const ctx = document.getElementById('barChart').getContext('2d');
  const barChart = new Chart(ctx, {
      type: 'bar',
      data: {
          labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
          datasets: [{
              label: 'Votes',
              data: [12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3],
              backgroundColor: [
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                  'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                  'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)',
                  'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                  'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
                  'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)'
              ],
              borderColor: [
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                  'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                  'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)',
                  'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                  'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)',
                  'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)'
              ],
              borderWidth: 1
          }]
      },
      options: {
          scales: {
              y: {
                  beginAtZero: true
              }
          }
      }
  });
```

- **Line Charts**: Best for showing trends over time or continuous data. Line charts are useful when you want to highlight changes and patterns.

```js
  const ctx = document.getElementById('lineChart').getContext('2d');
  const lineChart = new Chart(ctx, {
      type: 'line',
      data: {
          labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June'],
          datasets: [{
              label: 'Sales',
              data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60],
              borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
              tension: 0.1
          }]
      },
      options: {}
  });
```

- **Pie and Doughnut Charts**: Suitable for displaying proportions and parts of a whole. Use these charts when you want to highlight distribution.

```js
  const ctx = document.getElementById('doughnutChart').getContext('2d');
  const doughnutChart = new Chart(ctx, {
      type: 'doughnut',
      data: {
          labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow'],
          datasets: [{
              label: 'Votes',
              data: [300, 50, 100],
              backgroundColor: [
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
                  'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
                  'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)'
              ],
              borderColor: [
                  'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
                  'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)',
                  'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)'
              ],
              borderWidth: 1
          }]
      },
      options: {}
  });
```

### Design for Clarity and Readability

Clear and readable charts help users understand data quickly and accurately:

- **Use Appropriate Labels**: Ensure that all axes, data points, and legends are clearly labeled. Avoid cluttering the chart with too much information.
- **Color Choices**: Use contrasting colors to differentiate between data points or categories. Ensure that color choices are accessible to those with color vision deficiencies.
- **Simplify Data**: Avoid overloading the chart with too much data. Focus on the key message you want to convey and use additional charts for supplementary information.
- **Consistent Scale**: Use a consistent scale across charts when comparing similar data sets. This helps users make accurate comparisons without recalibrating their understanding of the scale.

```js
  const ctx = document.getElementById('clarityChart').getContext('2d');
  const clarityChart = new Chart(ctx, {
      type: 'line',
      data: {
          labels: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June'],
          datasets: [{
              label: 'Sales',
              data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60],
              borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
              tension: 0.1
          }]
      },
      options: {
          scales: {
              y: {
                  beginAtZero: true
              }
          }
      }
  });
```

### Make Charts Accessible

Accessibility ensures that your charts can be understood by all users, including those with disabilities:

- **Use ARIA Labels**: Implement ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) labels to provide additional context to screen readers.

```html
  <canvas id="accessibleChart" aria-label="Sales Data" role="img"></canvas>
```

- **Provide Alternative Text**: Include descriptive alternative text for charts, especially if the chart is complex. This helps users who rely on screen readers to understand the chart's content.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements of the chart, such as tooltips and legends, are accessible via keyboard navigation.
- **High Contrast Colors**: Use high contrast colors for better visibility, especially for users with low vision or color blindness.

```js
  const ctx = document.getElementById('accessibleChart').getContext('2d');
  const accessibleChart = new Chart(ctx, {
      type: 'bar',
      data: {
          labels: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Purple', 'Orange'],
