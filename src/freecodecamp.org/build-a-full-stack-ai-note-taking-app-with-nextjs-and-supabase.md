Taking notes is a fundamental skill for staying organized, whether you're a student, professional, or developer. But what if your notes could do more than just store information? Imagine having an intelligent note-taking app that allows you to organize your thoughts, retrieve them effortlessly, and even interact with them using AI. This course will guide you through building exactly that.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a full-stack note-taking app using Next.js 15's App Router, Supabase for authentication and database management, Prisma ORM for efficient data handling, and shadcn for clean, modern styling. This project also integrates the OpenAI API, allowing users to engage with their notes through AI-generated responses. By the end of the course, you will have a fully functional web application deployed on Vercel.

This course, created by Cole Blender, walks you through the entire development process step by step. You will start with project setup, styling, and authentication before moving on to database integration and core feature development. Once the core functionality is in place, you will enhance the app by integrating OpenAI’s API, enabling AI-driven interactions. Finally, you will deploy the application so it is accessible online.

Throughout the course, you will gain hands-on experience with Next.js 15’s App Router, which introduces a new way of structuring and handling server-side logic. You will also work with Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative, to manage authentication and databases seamlessly. Prisma ORM will make database interactions more efficient and type-safe, while shadcn will help you design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

One of the most exciting parts of the project is adding AI-powered functionality. By integrating OpenAI’s API, you will allow users to ask ChatGPT questions related to their notes. This feature transforms the note-taking app from a simple text storage tool into an interactive assistant that helps users analyze and retrieve information effortlessly.

Once your application is complete, you will deploy it to Vercel, ensuring that it is optimized for performance and accessible to users worldwide. Deployment is an essential skill for any developer, and this course provides a hands-on guide to making your project live on the web.

By following along, you will not only build a feature-rich application but also strengthen your understanding of full-stack development.
