Accordion menus are everywhere on the web because users want fast answers and smooth navigation.

They help create clean, organized, and user-friendly interfaces. Many developers still reach for JavaScript to build accordions, which adds avoidable complexities to their projects.

The HTML `<details>` element solves this problem with its built-in disclosure widget that toggles content visibility using just a few lines of HTML and optional CSS.

In this article, weâ€™ll look at an FAQ accordion built using `<details>`.

---

## What is the HTML `<details>` Element?

The HTML `<details>` element is a disclosure widget that allows you to hide and show content with a single click. Think of it as a native accordion that comes built into HTML.

The most common use case for accordions is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section on many sites. If youâ€™ve seen or interacted with an FAQ, thatâ€™s an opportunity to use `<details>`.

It has two main components:

- `<details>` is the main container tag that opens and closes to display whatâ€™s in `<summary>`.
- `<summary>` is a container for the content that is displayed when `<details>` is clicked.

ðŸ’¡ In addition to the `summary`, you can include any HTML text element within the `<details>` container.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1752662432707/0d6ebbae-d68d-400f-9209-a83feec273b7.png)

The image above shows a real-life use case of `<details>` on the Apple website. In a later section, weâ€™ll learn about the browsers that support it.

### When to Use `<details>` over JavaScript alternatives

Unlike JavaScript-based accordions that add weight to your project, `<details>` offers the same functionality with minimal load and better performance. It also offers built-in keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

Choose `<details>` over JavaScript-created accordions when:

- Building simple accordions or FAQ sections
- Accessibility, performance, and SEO are a priority
- You want to avoid JavaScript dependencies

## An FAQ Accordion Built with the `<details>` Element

Hereâ€™s what our example project looks like:

![Example project using the  element](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1752662715342/74db7ba5-f7a6-44be-974c-36c0418c4a81.png)

This design is by [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/?via=ophyboamah) (and you can check out the project on [Codepen (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-codepen"/>`ophyboamah`)](https://codepen.io/ophyboamah/full/ByaRqaN)).

To follow along, you need basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. Since the focus of this article is `<details>`, we won't place a lot of emphasis on the starting HTML and CSS code (available on the Codepen above). Instead, we'll look at one FAQ question with its answer to learn how `<details>` works.

### How to Use `<details>`

To create an accordion with the `<details>` element, you need both the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements, as shown in the starter code below.

```html
<details>
  <summary>What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?</summary>
  <p>Frontend Mentor offers realistic coding challenges to help developers improve their frontend coding skills with projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s suitable for all levels and ideal for portfolio building.</p>
</details>
```

The GIF below will be the result after running the above code. With less than five lines of HTML code, we already have an accordion.

### Styling `<details>`

Now, let's focus on transforming our basic accordion into something visually appealing (foundational styles can be found on the [Codepen (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-codepen"/>`ophyboamah`)](https://codepen.io/ophyboamah/full/ByaRqaN)). First, weâ€™ll add the icons as SVGs within `<summary>` with classes (closed-icon and open-icon) to make them easy to style.

```html :collapsed-lines
<details>
  <summary>What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?

  </summary>
  <p>Frontend Mentor offers realistic coding challenges to help developers improve their frontend coding skills with projects in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s suitable for all levels and ideal for portfolio building.</p>
</details>
```

In the code below, we customize the disclosure marker by hiding the default arrow and adding a custom icon to the right using the `::marker` pseudo-element on `<summary>`. We also set its content as empty, which removes the marker altogether.

```css :collapsed-lines
/* Styles for the clickable summary element*/
summary {
  font-weight: 700;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  transition: color 0.2s ease;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  padding: 1.5em;
/* Remove the default marker */
  &::marker {
    content: '';
  }

  &:last-child { 
    margin-bottom: 0; 
  } 

  &:hover { 
    color: var(--text-accent);
    outline: none;
  }
}

p {
  padding-top: 1em;
  color: var(--text-light);
}
/* Styles for the collapsible <details> container */
details {
  margin-bottom: 1em;

  &:last-child { 
    margin-bottom: 0; 
  }

  .open-icon {
    display: none;
  }

  &[open] {
    .open-icon {
      display: inline;
    }

    .closed-icon {
      display: none;
    }
  }

  .open-icon,
  .closed-icon {
    width: 1.8em; 
    height: 1.8em;
    flex-shrink: 0;
  }
}
```

The GIF below shows the output of styling our accordion with the CSS code above.

To have an FAQ question expanded when the page loads, add the `open` attribute to `<details>`. This is particularly useful for highlighting important information where the most crucial FAQ starts expanded.

```html
<details open>
  <summary>What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?</summary>
</details>
```

## Browser Support and Accessibility Considerations

According to [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-firefox"/>MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/details), `<details>` is a well established feature that works across many devices and the popular browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari) since January 2020.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1752663542331/33407311-a4db-47ab-bc9f-16baaed5d060.png)

`<details>` includes built-in accessibility features that requires additional JavaScript in custom solutions such as keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and semantic structure. You can also add attributes like role, aria-expanded, and aria-labelledby to ensure even more accessibility.

---

## Conclusion

`<details>` is a powerful yet under-utilized element for creating UI elements like accordions, FAQs, or navigation menus without JavaScript. It is easy to implement and lightweight, and yet improves user experience with interactive content.

So, the next time you need to create any collapsible content, with accessibility and performance in mind, consider reaching for `<details>` and it will surely make your development life easier.
