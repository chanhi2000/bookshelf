AI-driven testing tools can make testing easier by handling system changes. They can automatically adapt to modifications in the system under test, without the need for manual intervention in the test scripts. They also reduce the need to fix test scripts.

By leveraging machine learning, these tools can detect patterns, identify errors, and continuously improve the test cases, ensuring they remain relevant and effective. Some AI-driven tools also utilize self-healing scripts that automatically adjust to changes in the system, such as UI updates or code modifications. This eliminates the need for manual updates to the scripts and allows tests to continue running smoothly.

::: tip Example: Using Panaya Smart Testing for Oracle ERP Automation

Panaya Smart Testing is an AI-driven tool. It’s designed to optimize the testing process for Oracle ERP systems. The tool addresses the complexities of Oracle environments, which ensures that your Oracle applications run smoothly with minimal manual effort.

:::

## What Does Panaya Smart Testing Do?

You can use Panaya Smart Testing to automate testing your Oracle ERP applications. It ensures that updates, upgrades, and configurations don’t break existing functionality.

The tool uses AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze your ERP system. It generates automated test cases based on how the application behaves. It also performs impact analysis to detect the potential effects of changes before they are applied.

In Oracle ERP environments, changes happen often. Panaya Smart Testing helps reduce the time you spend on manual regression testing. It automates testing for both functional and non-functional requirements. These include system performance and UI behavior.

---

## Results of Panaya Smart Testing

### Faster Testing and Feedback

Panaya’s AI-driven engine generates test cases and runs tests. This speeds up the testing cycle. You get faster feedback on system changes.

### Reduced Risk of Errors

Panaya detects issues caused by changes or upgrades. It helps prevent defective updates from being deployed. The system will work as expected after the changes.

### Continuous Test Coverage

Panaya maintains continuous test coverage throughout the development cycle. It tests all parts of the Oracle ERP system. This prevents regressions and new bugs from appearing.

### Reduced Manual Effort

Panaya reduces the need for manual testing. It automatically runs tests, analyzes impacts, and suggests improvements. This helps QA teams focus on more important tasks.

## How to Use Panaya Smart Testing for Oracle ERP Automation

### Set Up Your Oracle ERP System on Panaya

Start by linking your Oracle ERP environment to Panaya. The tool integrates seamlessly with Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Cloud, and other Oracle applications. Setup is quick and testing capabilities are immediate.

### Perform Impact Analysis

Panaya’s impact analysis engine detects changes to your Oracle ERP system. It identifies affected areas and suggests tests to run.

### How to Set Up Panaya for Test Automation

First, you need to create your test scripts in Panaya. You typically do this by recording or scripting your test cases within the Panaya Test Automation platform. Let's break it down:

#### 1. Record Test Cases in Panaya:

- Log into Panaya and navigate to the Test Management section.
- Create a new test case or use an existing one.
- Use the recording feature to simulate user interactions with your application (for example, logging in, clicking buttons, navigating between pages).
- Save and publish your tests.

::: tip Example Test Case

Let’s say you are automating a login test for an enterprise app. The Panaya test will look like this:

- **Step 1**: Open the application URL.
- **Step 2**: Enter the username and password.
- **Step 3**: Click the login button.
- **Step 4**: Verify that the homepage is displayed.

:::

#### 2. Exporting Panaya Test Scripts

Once you have your test cases ready in Panaya, you can export them to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline. This step usually involves generating test scripts in a format compatible with your testing tools (for example, Java, Python, or Selenium scripts).

::: info Export Steps

1. From the Panaya interface, choose the test case you want to export.
2. Panaya can export the test cases in different formats, but for this guide, we will focus on exporting as JUnit or TestNG compatible scripts.

:::

### 3. How to Integrate Panaya with Jenkins

Now that we have the test scripts, let's integrate them with Jenkins to run them automatically.

#### Step 1: Set Up a Jenkins Job

1. **Create a Jenkins pipeline job:**
    - In Jenkins, go to New Item, select Pipeline, and name it something like "Panaya_Test_Job".
    - Click OK.
2. **Set Up Git Repository** (for the test scripts):
    - Under Source Code Management, choose Git and provide the URL to your repository where the exported Panaya test scripts are stored.
3. **Configure Pipeline:**
    - Define the pipeline script under the Pipeline section. Here's an example script that pulls the test scripts and runs them:

```groovy title="Jenkinsfile"
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/panaya-tests.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run the Panaya tests using Maven or Gradle
                    sh 'mvn clean test'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Publish Test Results') {
            steps {
                junit '**/target/test-*.xml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- This pipeline:
  - Checks out your repository (where Panaya test scripts are stored).
  - Runs the tests using Maven (assuming your test scripts are in Java).
  - Publishes test results in JUnit format so you can see the results in Jenkins.

#### Step 2: Trigger Jenkins Job Automatically

To trigger the Jenkins job on each commit or pull request, under Build Triggers, enable GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling (if using GitHub).

#### Step 3: Jenkins Test Execution

After the job is triggered (via Git push, pull request, or manual), Jenkins will pull the latest code and run the tests. The test results will appear in the Test Results section in Jenkins.

### 4. How to Integrate Panaya with GitHub Actions

If you're using **GitHub Actions** instead of Jenkins, here's how to automate the process:

#### Step 1: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create a Workflow File:**
    - In your GitHub repo, create a <FontIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.github/workflows` folder.
    - Add a YAML file (for example, <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-yaml"/>`ci.yml`).

```yaml :collapsed-lines title=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
name: Panaya Test Automation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        java-version: '11'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: mvn install

    - name: Run Panaya Tests
      run: mvn clean test

    - name: Upload test results
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: test-results
        path: target/test-*.xml
```

#### Step 2: Run and View Results

Once the code is pushed to the `main` branch or a pull request is created, GitHub Actions will trigger the workflow. The tests will run automatically.

Then the test results will be uploaded as artifacts for easy viewing.

### 5. How to Review Test Results

After tests are executed in both Jenkins and GitHub Actions:

- **Jenkins**: Go to the Jenkins job's Build History. You can view the test results and logs. If you configured the JUnit plugin, it will show a detailed breakdown of passed and failed tests.
- **GitHub Actions**: You can find test results in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository. The results will be available under the workflow run.
