On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Suz Hinton. She's a software engineer, security researcher, and one of the first ever people to live-stream her coding on Twitch.

We talk about:

- How Suz started her career building browser ads in Adobe Flash, working around bandwidth early 2000s limitations.
- How she moved to the US from Melbourne to work at Zappos, and then Microsoft and Stripe.
- Her love of hardware and embedded development
- How she went back to school to study infosec, and launched a second career as a security researcher
- How she nearly burned out after 20 years in tech, and what she's doing to recover.

Can you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's a 2015 song from an Australian musician.
