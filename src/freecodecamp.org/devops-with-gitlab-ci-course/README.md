GitLab CI/CD can automatically build, test, deploy, and monitor your applications.

We just published a full course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to use GitLab CI.

Valentin Despa developed this course. Valentin is an experienced developer and course creator.

In this course, you will learn how to use GitLab CI to create CI/CD pipelines for building and deploying software to AWS.

Here are all the sections covered in this course:
