By reading this post, you are going to *really* understand `git merge`, one of the most common operations you'll perform in your Git repositories.

::: note Before we start

1. I also created two videos covering the contents of this post. If you wish to watch alongside reading, you can find them here ([<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Part 1](https://youtu.be/ZS4stBVdDII) [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Part 2](https://youtu.be/BCNZ5Uxctuk&t=561s)).
2. I am working on a book about Git! Are you interested in reading the initial versions and providing feedback? Send me an email: [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-envelope"/>`gitting.things@gmail.com`](mailto://gitting.things@gmail.com)

## Recap

In this guide, you got an extensive overview of merging with Git. You learned that merging is the process of combining the recent changes from several branches into a single new commit. The new commit has two parents ‚Äì those commits which had been the tips of the branches that were merged.

We considered a simple, fast-forward merge, which is possible when one branch diverged from the base branch, and then just added commits on top of the base branch.

We then considered three-way merges, and explained the three-stage process:

- First, Git locates the merge base. As a reminder, this is the first commit that is reachable from both branches.
- Second, Git calculates two diffs ‚Äì one diff from the merge base to the *first* branch, and another diff from the merge base to the *second* branch. Git generates patches based on those diffs.
- Third and last, Git applies both patches to the merge base using a 3-way merge algorithm. The result is the state of the new, merge commit.

We dove deeper into the process of a 3-way merge, whether at a file level or a hunk level. We considered when Git is able to rely on a 3-way merge to automatically resolve conflicts, and when it just can't.

You saw the output of `git diff` when we are in a conflicting state, and how to resolve conflicts either manually or with VS Code.

There is much more to be said about merges ‚Äì different merge strategies, recursive merges, and so on. Yet, after this guide, you should have a robust understanding of what merge is, and what happens under the hood in the vast majority of cases.
