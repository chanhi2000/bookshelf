Did you apply to Outreachy and receive a “Your Initial Application Was Not Successful” email? Or maybe you got into the contribution stage but after a rigorous month of contribution, you were not selected as an intern. How disheartening that can be!

Rejection stings, especially when you’ve poured your heart and time into an application. [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Outreachy](https://outreachy.org/) is competitive, and not everyone who applies will make it through.

So if you’ve found yourself on the other side of the selection list, don’t despair. The Open Source sky is wide enough for every bird to fly.

If you're truly passionate about [contributing to open source](/freecodecamp.org/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-as-a-beginner.md) and building a successful open source career, this article offers practical advice on how to pursue that path—whether you get into Outreachy or not.

---

## Why You Were Not Selected

First, it’s important to understand the context. Outreachy receives hundreds of applications for a limited number of slots. The selection process is rigorous, and even highly qualified applicants may not be chosen due to factors beyond their control.

Note that this is just my perspective, drawn from personal experience and conversations with other past interns. It may not fully reflect the specific reasons why mentors or organizers might not select an applicant. But the factors I’ll discuss are worth considering and can help guide your future applications.

### 1. Project fit

Project fit is about more than just matching technical skills. I often advise applicants to choose projects that they’re passionate about. It’s not enough to only have the technical skills the project requires. Do your interests align with the project’s goals? Have you shown an understanding of its challenges? Are your contributions relevant to what the project actually needs?

Mentors look for candidates who don't just want an internship, but who genuinely care about the project's mission. They seek individuals who can see beyond the code to the broader impact of the open source initiative.

### 2. Contribution quality

Applicants are encouraged to start with smaller tasks and progress to more complex ones. But because contributions are tracked, some applicants may be tempted to focus on the quantity of their contributions rather than the quality.

If you were a mentor for a project focused on improving accessibility, whom would you choose: an applicant who has logged 10 contributions, all consisting of typo fixes in documentation? Or one who has made 2 contributions, including a comprehensive accessibility audit and a detailed report?

One thoughtful, high-quality contribution often outweighs several superficial ones because it demonstrates your potential to add real value to the project.

### 3. Overall application narrative

Your application is a story, not just a list of achievements.

- How compellingly do you explain your motivations?
- Do you demonstrate a long-term commitment to open source?
- Can you articulate your learning goals?
- Do you show potential for growth?
- How do you connect your past experiences to the project?

Mentors read hundreds of applications. Those that tell a coherent, passionate story are more likely to stand out.

### 4. The sheer volume of exceptional candidates

Sometimes, there are just so many exceptional applicants and not enough internship slots. It’s a tough decision for the mentors.

In this case, whether you’re selected or not is a matter of mathematical probability. So, if you are not selected, it doesn't mean you're not skilled or deserving enough. Understanding this can help you approach rejection with a growth mindset rather than self-doubt.

## Should You Reapply?

> "If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again" — William Edward Hickson

Many successful Outreachy interns were not selected on their first try. I’m one of them. If you’re eligible and still passionate about the program, by all means, reapply.

Here’s how to strengthen your next application:

**Start Early:** Start exploring [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>past Outreachy projects](https://outreachy.org/past-projects/) and building connections with mentors well before the application phase. Some communities (for example, Oppia, Wikimedia, Fedora, and Bioconductor) are regular Outreachy participants and are likely to participate in the next internship round.

**Expand Your Skills:** Use the time between application cycles to deepen your knowledge in areas that align with Outreachy projects, whether it’s coding, documentation, or community management.

A friend of mine, Karimot Isiaka, started learning about accessibility after discovering that the project I worked on during my Outreachy internship was focused on this area. Today, she’s one of the December 2024 interns working on a project centered around accessibility. Had she not taken the initiative to expand her skills and dive into accessibility, she likely wouldn’t have been prepared for this opportunity. Be like Karimot.

**Build Relationships:** Join project communities, participate in discussions, and contribute consistently. Mentors often notice applicants who’ve been active contributors.

## Alternative Routes to Contributing to Open Source

Outreachy has played a significant role in introducing people from underrepresented groups to open source, providing mentorship, and offering a pathway to impactful contributions. But it’s just one route among many. Open source is a vast ecosystem, filled with opportunities to learn, grow, and even build a career.

Here are other ways to make an impact in open source:

### 1. Independent Contributions

One of the most direct ways to get involved in open source is by contributing independently to projects that align with your interests. You can:

- Go on [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>GitHub](https://github.com/) or [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-gitlab"/>Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and look for issues tagged as “good first issue” or “help wanted.”
- Contribute to documentation, test cases, or bug fixes.
- Participate in [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/), an annual celebration that encourages people to contribute to open source projects while earning rewards and gaining experience.

Independent contributions allow you to build a portfolio and demonstrate your skills in a practical context, which can be just as impactful as participating in a formal program. [Here’s a helpful article](/freecodecamp.org/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-projects-as-a-beginner.md) by Fanny Nyayic about how to get started as a beginner open source contributor.

- **Full-Time Roles:** Many tech companies hire developers to focus exclusively on maintaining or enhancing open source projects they rely on or sponsor.

### 4. Non-Code Contributions

Non-code contributions are an underrated yet valuable way to get involved. If you’re a non-technical person, you can contribute to open source in any of the following ways:

- **Design:** Creating UI/UX designs or social media graphics for open source projects.
- **Community management:** Moderating forums, organizing meetups, or managing social media. Amarachi Johnson has a [helpful article here](/freecodecamp.org/contributing-to-open-source-as-a-community-manager.md) on contributing to open source projects as a community manager.
- **Advocacy:** Writing articles, giving talks, or creating tutorials about the project. Christine Belzie has a [helpful article here](/freecodecamp.org/improve-tech-writing-skills-by-contributing-to-open-source.md) on how technical writers can contribute to OSS.

### 5. Personal Projects

If you’re passionate about solving a particular problem, consider [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>starting your own open source project](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/). That side project you’re working on? You could make it open source. Invite other people to contribute. Build an open source community around this project you care about. Who knows? You could build the next freeCodeCamp.

## Keep Contributing to Open Source

Rejection hurts, but it’s not the end of the road. Many accomplished contributors faced rejection at some point. Some didn’t make it into Outreachy or GSoC but went on to become project maintainers, speakers, or leaders in the open source space.

If you haven’t gotten into Outreachy, take a moment to regroup and then try again. And while you’re at it, explore other opportunities. Don’t give up. Rejection is just a step in the journey. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find your place in the open source world.
