AI-powered chat applications are becoming an essential part of modern web development, enabling users to interact with intelligent conversational agents. Whether for customer support, virtual assistants, or educational tools, building your own AI chat app can be a rewarding and practical project. If you're interested in learning how to integrate powerful AI models into a web application, this course is perfect for you.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build an AI chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Developed by Harris from Coding Cleverly, this hands-on course will guide you through the entire development process. You'll work with cutting-edge AI tools like the ChatGPT API, Google’s BERT, and the DeepSeek R1 model. By the end, you'll have a fully functional AI chat app and a strong understanding of backend setup, API integration, and database management.

::: info What You’ll Learn

This course provides a structured approach to building an AI chat app from scratch. Here’s what you’ll cover:

- **Introduction** – Get an overview of the project and the technologies used.
- **npm init** – Set up the Node.js project with the necessary dependencies.
- **Backend Folder** – Organize the backend structure for efficient development.
- **MongoDB Integration** – Learn how to connect and manage data with MongoDB.
- **OpenAI Tokens** – Set up and securely manage API keys for ChatGPT integration.
- **MongoDB Issues** – Troubleshoot common database connection issues.
