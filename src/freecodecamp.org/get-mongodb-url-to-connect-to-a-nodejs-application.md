In my [**previous article about building a Node.js application**](/freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-an-event-app-with-node-js.md), I didnâ€™t fully explain how to obtain the MongoDB URL, as I wanted to keep the article concise. However, I realized that this information is essential for saving data to MongoDB.

In this article, I will guide you through the process of getting your MongoDB URL so you can connect your application effectively. By the end of this tutorial, youâ€™ll have a clear understanding of how to retrieve your MongoDB URL.

---

## Step 1: Search for MongoDB or Visit their Website

To begin, head to the [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-mongodb"/>MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) website.

![Mongodb website](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/mongodb-website.png)

---

## Step 2: Click on the Sign In button on their website.

This will redirect you to the MongoDB login page. If you donâ€™t have an account yet, you can create one by selecting the **Sign Up** option instead. Since I already have an account, I will log in to access my MongoDB dashboard.

---

## Step 3: Access the Dashboard

Once you log in, you'll have access to the dashboard. But first, you need to create a project folder.

### Why Do You Need a Project Folder?

This is for organizational purposes, helping you keep track of which projects you are working on.

**To create a project folder**

- Click on the **Projects** section at the top, indicated by a folder icon. This will reveal a dropdown menu.
- From the dropdown, click on **New Project**. This will redirect you to a page where you can create your new project.

![Create a new project](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/use-mongodb.gif)

- Click the **Next** button to proceed to the project creation page.

![Creating a project continues](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/create-project.png)

After creating your project, you will be redirected back to your dashboard, where you will see your newly created project folder. You can now start working on this specific project.

## Step 4: Creating a Cluster

To obtain the MongoDB connection URL, it is essential to create a **Cluster**.

### What is a cluster?

A cluster in MongoDB is a group of servers that work together to store and manage your data, providing high availability and scalability.

**To create a cluster:**

1. On your dashboard, click on the **Clusters** button as shown in the picture of **Step 3** above.
2. Next, this will direct you to a page called "**Deploy your cluster**" where you get to create your cluster.

---

## Step 5: Create a Username for Your Connection URL

After creating a cluster, you will be taken to a page where you need to create a username and password for the connection URL. The password can be autogenerated, or you can create your own.

![Creating Username and password](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/creating-a-username-for-mongodb.png)

### Why Do I Have to Create a Username?

Creating a username is essential for managing access to your MongoDB cluster. A username, along with a password, ensures that only authorized users can access your database. This adds a layer of security, protecting your data from unauthorized access.

### Benefits of creating a username:

- **Security:** Ensures that your database is only accessible to those with the correct credentials.
- **Management:** You can track who is accessing your database and manage permissions.
- **Accountability:** Helps in auditing and monitoring activities within your database.

---

## Step 6: Auto Generation of The MongoDB Connection URL

Once you click the **Create User** button, you will be redirected to a page where your connection URL is automatically generated. Copy this URL and paste it into your `.env` file to establish a connection to your database. Alternatively, you can paste it directly into your <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-js"/>`app.js` or <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-js"/>`server.js` file, as I [**explained in my previous article**](/freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-an-event-app-with-node-js.md).

Feel free to let me know if you need assistance!

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this article, you should now understand how to obtain your MongoDB connection URL. Remember, creating a username and password for your database access is crucial for ensuring the security and management of your data.
