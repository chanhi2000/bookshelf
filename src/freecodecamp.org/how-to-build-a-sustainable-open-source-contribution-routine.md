Contributing to open source sounds fun until life gets in the way. You get busy, you forget or you don’t know where to start again.

This is why having a routine is so important. Not just for the sake of ticking boxes, but because consistency has a great effect: one pull request builds into another, one comment turns into a conversation, one contribution creates an opening.

Let’s talk about how you can build a contribution habit that actually holds.

## How to Build an Open Source Contribution Routine

Starting to contribute to open source can feel overwhelming, but it becomes easier once you build a simple routine. With clear goals and steady habits, you’ll stay consistent and motivated. Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Define Your Motivation and Goals

Before you write your first line of code or fix your first typo, ask yourself: Why am I doing this?

People contribute to open source for many reasons. Some land new jobs, build businesses, or form partnerships with big companies. Others win prizes, gain recognition, or simply enjoy being part of a collaborative community.

For example, my friend [Param (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-linkedin"/>`paramsiddharth`)](https://linkedin.com/in/paramsiddharth/) joined the MLH Fellowship to grow as a software engineer by working alongside mentors and peers. Since then, his career has taken off.

Maybe you want to sharpen your technical skills, find mentorship, or give back to a project that helped you grow. Whatever your reason is, write it down and be clear about it.

Writing down your reason gives you direction and keeps you motivated. Then, turn that “why” into a measurable goal:

- Make one contribution per week
- Get comfortable with Python testing
- Join a community call once a month

Clear goals help you track progress and stay focused on your purpose.

### 2. Choose the Right Projects

It’s often better to start small. Rather than submitting your first pull request to a large, complex project, begin with easier tasks like fixing a typo or improving documentation.

This approach helps you understand the contribution process and gives you confidence to take on more involved issues later.

To find beginner-friendly tasks, you can search for your preferred programming language in the GitHub search bar, then select **Issues** from the left sidebar. Here’s what that looks like:

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeg4C-_JHD5uzo-9UN_EXPKVObWKbQpuq8sEyb083_dchXQlrZ9HFzR2j0xtfAeNeY8JMqXiBc2ayCQ26PttfJTuGGi9LMgpwBbbhmKeW4jkoNmrdAgDAomiYo5kOH0MS0BAsK4PA?key=5pXEvcqHzwuwd-lKS3C88S61)

But manually checking each GitHub result for suitable issues can get overwhelming over time. To avoid burnout and save time, try using platforms like [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/), [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/), or [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>CodeTriage](https://codetriage.com/). These platforms help you discover projects that are actively looking for contributors like you.

Here’s how each works:

| **Platform** | **How to Use It** |
| ---: | :--- |
| **First Contributions** | Browse the project library on the homepage, choose a project with your preferred language tag, and start contributing |
| **Up For Grabs** | Browse the project library, filter projects using tags, and start contributing |
| **CodeTriage** | Sign up on CodeTriage, filter projects by language, visit the project GitHub page and start contributing |

Some tips for beginners:

- Pick something you're genuinely interested in. You're more likely to stay engaged and push through challenges if the project aligns with your passions or long-term goals.
- Choose projects that fit your current level but still offer room for growth. The sweet spot is where you're challenged enough to learn without feeling overwhelmed.
- Check for clear and active contribution guidelines. A well-documented contributing guide, readme, and issue tracker show that the maintainers care about helping contributors succeed.
- Look for projects that welcome newcomers. Explore how maintainers respond to issues and pull requests. A friendly, constructive tone in comments is a good sign that they value and support new contributors.

### 3. Create a Consistent Schedule

Open source doesn’t have to take over your nights or weekends. It just needs a dedicated time slot that fits your routine, whether it’s 30 minutes after dinner, Saturday mornings with coffee, or one task every Sunday night.

Even if you’re working on a big problem, you don’t have to spend hours in one go on it. Just keep track of it and do it at your own pace. There might also be a deadline for your issue, depending on how you found it.

Use time-blocking or the Pomodoro technique to stay focused during that time. Track your progress with a checklist, GitHub activity graph, or Notion board. A visible streak can keep your motivation strong and help you build lasting momentum.

### 4. Engage With the Community

At the end of the day, humans are running the open-source projects, from maintainers to contributors. The more you interact, the easier it becomes to navigate the project and find meaningful ways to contribute.

Join the project’s Discord, Slack, or mailing list to stay updated and get a feel for the team culture. Comment on issues, even if it's just to ask for clarification or thank someone for their work. Attend community calls or syncs when you can.

You can also join general open-source communities like [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-reddit"/>`r/opensource` on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/opensource/) or [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-gloibe"/>The Programmer’s Hangout](https://theprogrammershangout.com/).

You don’t need to be the loudest voice. Being present, respectful, and curious is often enough to build trust. And if you’re stuck, ask. Many maintainers are open to guiding contributors who show initiative and a willingness to learn.

Ask for coffee chats to connect with experts and learn from their experience over a call. Keep an eye on opportunity channels to get job, scholarship, and feature opportunities.

If you have two coffee chats a week, that’s one hour. Add 15 minutes a day for messaging or helping others, which comes to 150 minutes. In total, you spend around 2 hours and 45 minutes each week on community building, and that small effort can create meaningful connections.

Here’s a sample message you can send to people you’ve been interacting with in communities to have a coffee chat:

```
Hi [Name],
```

I’ve really enjoyed your insights in the [community/project name] discussions, and I’d love to learn more about your open source journey. Would you be open to a 15–20 minute virtual coffee chat sometime this week or next?

### 5. Leverage Tools

Tools make your life easier, no matter what task you’re working on. Luckily, most of these tools are free and can act as your assistants.

Here are a few good tools (and a little bit of automation) that can really help.

#### Tracking

Tools like GitHub’s contribution graph and a Notion checklist help you stay organized and avoid losing track of what you were working on. You can create a simple list of issues and update their status as you go, like "PR created," "PR reviewed," or "merged." Watching that list grow gives you a clear sense of progress, even when the steps feel small.

If your schedule is consistent, block a regular “Open Source Hour” on your calendar and link it to your active project list. This way, you always know what to work on next without having to think twice.

#### Skip the Setup Hassle

Setting up your dev environment every time can feel like a chore, especially if you're switching between projects or working on a lightweight machine. Tools like GitPod and Codespaces make this easier by spinning up a ready-to-code environment in your browser. No installs, no messy configurations. Just click and get started.

#### Stay Updated Without the Tab Overload

Keeping up with changelogs, release notes, and blog updates can get messy fast. Instead of jumping between tabs, use an RSS reader like Feedly. It pulls everything into one clean feed so you can stay in the loop without the noise.

#### Level Up With Your Own Dev Space

If you’re going deeper into open source and need to host a test version of your contribution, having your own environment makes things easier. A VPS (Virtual Private Server) gives you a clean, flexible space where you can:

- Host a test version of the project you're contributing to
- Reproduce bugs without affecting your local setup
- Set up your own CI pipelines or preview environments
- Run a dashboard, webhook listener, or static site

You don’t need anything fancy to start. Some of the most affordable and reliable VPS options include [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>InstanceHost](https://instancehost.com/), [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>OVH](https://ovhcloud.com/asia/vps/), and [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-hostinger"/>Hostinger](https://hostinger.com/). They offer solid performance without burning through your wallet. There are plenty of other options out there, but I’ve personally used these three and can vouch for them.

### 6. Take It to the Next Level With Structured Programs

If you're feeling motivated and ready to take on bigger goals, consider applying to open source programs that offer mentorship, structure, and real-world experience. Programs like [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>OnlyDust](https://onlydust.com/), [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Outreachy](https://outreachy.org/), [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>MLH Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/), [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Season of KDE](https://mentorship.kde.org/sok/), and [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>FOSSASIA Codeheat](https://codeheat.org/) help you grow as a contributor while working on meaningful projects with experienced mentors.

These opportunities often lead to full-time roles. Many participants have landed jobs at top tech companies by showcasing the skills and contributions they built during these programs.

Here’s how each one works:

- **OnlyDust:** OnlyDust’s "Wave" is a monthly program that connects thousands of developers with curated open source projects. As your contributions get merged, you earn recognition, climb the leaderboard, and build your reputation.
- **Hacktoberfest:** A month-long celebration of open source held every October. It encourages first-time contributors to make meaningful pull requests while engaging with the global open source community.
- **Outreachy**: A paid, remote internship for people from underrepresented backgrounds in tech. You work on an open source project for about three months with close mentorship.
- **MLH Fellowship**: A 12-week remote program where you collaborate with other fellows on open source projects. Partner companies like Meta, GitHub, and Amazon often sponsor teams.
- **Season of KDE**: A mentorship program focused on contributing to KDE projects. You work with KDE developers over a few months while building real features and getting feedback.
- **FOSSASIA Codeheat**: A global contest where contributors work on FOSSASIA projects. It’s open to everyone and includes mentorship, recognition, and sometimes job referrals.

## The Long-Term Value of Showing Up

Open source contributions might seem like free work at first, but in the long run, they can open doors to a successful career. It helps you grow your skills, build a network, and show what you’re capable of all in public. With the right routine, your small, consistent efforts can lead to big outcomes.
