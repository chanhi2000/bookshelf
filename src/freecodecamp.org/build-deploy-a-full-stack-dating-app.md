Creating a modern, full-stack web application has never been more exciting, thanks to the wide array of powerful tools available to developers today. If you’ve ever thought about building a dynamic, feature-rich app but weren’t sure where to start, this comprehensive guide is for you.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build and deploy a modern dating application from scratch. This course uses cutting-edge tools and frameworks, including **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **NextAuth**, **Cloudinary**, and **Pusher**, to create a professional-grade app with features like authentication, real-time messaging, media uploads, and more. By the end of the course, you’ll also learn how to deploy your app to **Vercel**, ensuring it’s production-ready and accessible to users. Eric Tech developed this course. Eric is a software developer at Microsoft.

## Why This Course Stands Out

This course goes beyond the basics, offering a full-stack experience that includes both backend and frontend development. You'll start by setting up your development environment with **Next.js** and **NextUI** for smooth routing and a polished user interface. As you progress, you’ll learn how to implement user authentication and secure your app with **NextAuth** and **Prisma**, giving you a robust foundation for managing user data. Real-time features like live chat and presence indicators are powered by **Pusher**, while **Cloudinary** simplifies media uploads for user profiles. The course also covers advanced features such as filtering, pagination, OAuth integration, and admin functionalities.
