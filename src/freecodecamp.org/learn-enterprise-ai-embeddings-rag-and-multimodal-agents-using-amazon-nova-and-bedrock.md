Enterprise AI requires different skills and technologies than your basic OpenAI wrapper applications you see all over.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach all about Embeddings, RAG, Multimodal Models, and Agents with Amazon Nova. This course covers AI engineering. You will learn a ton of technologies from Amazon Tian Text Embeddings to LangChain integration with Amazon Bedrock. You'll build an end-to-end application utilizing Amazon Bedrock Agents and Knowledge Bases.

This course demonstrates practical applications of these technologies, such as automating and optimizing the insurance claim process with AI. You'll learn how to leverage Bedrock-powered agents to assist in tasks like claim creation, document management, and data retrieval, significantly enhancing efficiency and decision-making capabilities in customer service operations. Suman Debnath from Amazon developed this course.

Here are the sections covered in this course:

- Embeddings in NLP and LLMs
- Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)
- Amazon Tian Text Embeddings
- Multimodal LLMs
- Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
- Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models (BLIP-2)
- Amazon Nova Multimodal Model
- Multimodal RAG
- Agents with Knowledge Bases
- Resources
