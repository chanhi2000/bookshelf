Just as weâ€™ve created a **repository** and a **commit** without using `git init`, `git add` or `git commit`, now we will create and switch between **branches** without using porcelain commands (`git branch` or `git checkout`).

Itâ€™s perfectly understandable if you are excited, I am too ðŸ™‚

**Letâ€™s start:**

So far we only have one **branch**, named <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master`. To create another one with the name <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test` (as the equivalent of `git branch test`), we would need to simply create a file named <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test` within <FontIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\refs\heads`, and the contents of that file would be the same **commit**â€™s hash as the <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master` points to.

If we use `git log`, we can see that this is indeed the case

![both <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master` and <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test` point to this **commit**](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-131.png)

Letâ€™s also switch to our newly created branch (the equivalent of `git checkout test`). For that, we should change `HEAD` to point to our new branch:

![Switching to branch <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test` by changing `HEAD`](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-132.png)

As we can see, both `git status` and `git log` confirm that `HEAD` now points to <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test`, which is, therefore, the active branch.

![We can now use the commands we have already used to create another file and add it to the index](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-133.png)

Using the commands above, we have created a file named `test.txt`, with the content of `Testing`, created a corresponding **blob,** and added it to the **index**. We also created a **tree** representing the **index**.

Itâ€™s now time to create a **commit** referencing this **tree**. This time, we should also specify the *parent* of this **commit** â€” which would be the previous **commit**. We specify the parent using the `-p` switch of `git commit-tree`:

![We have just created a **commit**, with a **tree** as well as a parent, as we can see](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-139.png)

Will `git log` show us the new **commit**?

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-138.png)

As we can see, `git log` doesnâ€™t show anything new. Why is that? ðŸ¤” Remember that `git log` traces the **branches** to find relevant commits to show. It shows us now <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test` and the **commit** it points to, and it also shows <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master` which points to the same **commit**.

Thatâ€™s right â€” we need to change <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test` to point to our new **commit**. We can do that by simply changing the contents of <FontIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\refs\heads\test`:

![Image](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-140.png)

It worked! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥‚

`git log` goes to `HEAD`, which tells it to go to the branch <FontIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`test`, which points to **commit** `465...5e`, which links back to its parent **commit** `80e...8f`.

Feel free to admire the beauty, we *git* you. ðŸ˜Š
