We use our phones for everything  -  texting, banking, browsing, tracking our health, even unlocking our homes. But with all that convenience comes a lot of risk.

Apps are hungry for your data. Hackers are always looking for cracks in your security. And sometimes, we accidentally give away more than we realize.

The good news is you don’t need to be an expert to tighten things up.

Here are seven simple changes that can seriously improve your phone’s privacy. Each one takes just a few minutes, and together, they make your phone much harder to track, hack, or snoop on.

---

## Control What Tracks Your Location

Let’s start with location tracking.

Most people don’t realize how many apps can access their exact whereabouts. Even seemingly harmless apps like weather or games may collect this info in the background.

Some use it to target ads, others sell it to data brokers, and a few could open doors to more serious threats, like someone building a full profile of your movements.

To reduce the risk, go into your phone’s settings and [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>check which apps can access your location](https://avg.com/en/signal/prevent-your-phone-being-tracked). Both iPhone and Android let you limit access to “While Using” the app, instead of “Always.” This way, apps can’t track you silently in the background.

Also, turn off “Precise Location” for apps that don’t need it. Your phone will still know your city, but it won’t pinpoint your exact house. This one tweak keeps dozens of apps from silently tracking your every move.

## Make Your Passcode Stronger

Next up is your passcode. It’s your phone’s first line of defense, but far too many people still use weak ones  -  like birthdays, 123456, or just swiping a simple pattern.

If someone grabs your phone, a weak passcode makes it much easier for them to get in, especially if they’ve watched you unlock it a few times.

Switch to at least a six-digit PIN or, even better, an alphanumeric passcode with letters and numbers. Yes, it takes a second longer to type, but it’s far harder to guess.

And if your phone supports it, use your fingerprint for unlocking instead of facial recognition. Face unlock can sometimes be fooled by photos or similar faces, while fingerprints are generally more secure.

You should also consider enabling a setting that erases your data after multiple failed login attempts. This way, if your phone falls into the wrong hands, it won’t just be sitting there, waiting to be cracked.

## Cut Back Unnecessary App Permissions

Many apps ask for permissions they don’t really need.

A flashlight app that wants access to your contacts? A calendar app asking for microphone access? These are red flags.

The more permissions you grant, the more ways your data can leak  -  sometimes to advertisers, other times to third parties you’ve never heard of.

Go through your app permissions and turn off access that doesn’t make sense. Does that casual game really need your location? Does a recipe app need to see your photos? Probably not. This isn’t just about avoiding creepy behavior  -  it’s about reducing the number of ways bad actors can exploit your phone if something goes wrong.

Some malicious apps have been caught using these permissions to record audio, access files, or even track your activity across other apps. A regular permissions check-up can help stop that from happening.

## Switch to eSIM for Better Security

One of the most overlooked privacy upgrades is switching to an [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>eSIM card](https://saily.com/what-is-esim/). That’s a digital SIM card built into your phone, and it offers real advantages over traditional physical SIM cards. The biggest one is security.

Physical SIM cards can be switched out easily if someone steals your phone. There’s also the risk of SIM swapping  -  where attackers convince your carrier to transfer your number to a different SIM, giving them control of your calls, texts, and even two-factor authentication codes.

With an eSIM, there’s no physical card to remove, and activating or transferring it requires extra authentication through your carrier.

If your phone supports eSIM - and most modern iPhones, Pixels, and Galaxy devices do -  you can switch by contacting your mobile carrier or using their app.

Once your eSIM is set up, consider removing the physical SIM entirely. It’s one less way someone can try to hijack your phone number.

## Don’t Leave Bluetooth and Wi‑Fi Open

You might not think twice about leaving Bluetooth or Wi-Fi turned on, but doing so can leave your phone exposed.

Even when you’re not actively connected, your phone continues to look for known networks or nearby devices. This “sniffing” can give away your location, expose your device to tracking, or even let attackers try to exploit unpatched vulnerabilities.

For instance, there have been real-world attacks like [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-wikipedia-w"/>BlueBorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueBorne_%28security_vulnerability%29), which let hackers take over phones just by being nearby with Bluetooth turned on.

Another risk is “Wi-Fi spoofing” -  when someone sets up a fake public network to trick your phone into connecting, giving them access to your traffic.

To protect yourself, get into the habit of turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when you’re not using them. You’ll save battery, too.

If you’re connecting to public networks, avoid auto-connect settings and tell your phone to “forget” the network afterward. This keeps it from reconnecting without your knowledge later.

## Use Encrypted Messaging Apps

Plain old text messages are easy to intercept. Phone carriers can access them, and if someone manages to snoop on your network, they can read your texts without much effort. That’s why encrypted messaging apps matter.

[<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Signal](https://signal.org/#signal) is one of the best options out there. It uses end-to-end encryption, which means only you and the person you’re chatting with can read your messages. Not even the app company can see them. It’s also open-source, which means experts can inspect the code for flaws.

WhatsApp also uses strong encryption, but it’s owned by Meta (formerly Facebook), which has a spottier track record when it comes to data privacy.

If you’re serious about protecting private conversations  -  especially with family, coworkers, or anyone handling sensitive info  - make the switch to an encrypted app.

---

## Keep Your Software Updated

The last one is simple, but often ignored: keep your phone and apps updated. Every update includes security patches that fix known issues.

Hackers and malware often target devices running old software because those bugs are public knowledge by the time they strike. If your phone isn’t set to update automatically, change that now.

Also check your app updates regularly. Some apps introduce new permissions or bugs, so keeping everything current helps close those holes before they can be used against you.

Phones with outdated operating systems are more vulnerable to spyware, data theft, and unauthorized access. So even if you’re not excited about the new features, updates are your silent protectors behind the scenes.

## Conclusion

None of these steps will make you invisible -  but they will make your phone a lot harder to compromise. That’s the goal. Privacy isn’t about locking everything down forever. It’s about knowing what you’re sharing, and taking steps to control it.
