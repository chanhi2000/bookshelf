React 19 has just been released, bringing a wealth of new features and enhancements to this popular JavaScript library. For developers looking to stay ahead of the curve, understanding these updates is crucial. This course is designed to help you navigate the latest changes in React 19, from data mutation handling to the innovative new APIs aimed at improving user experience.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about the exciting new features in React 19. This includes built-in ways to handle actions, optimistic updates, form statuses, the new `use()` API, and much more. React 19 is packed with improvements that streamline the development process and enhance application performance, making it an essential update for any React developer.

Bob Ziroll from Scrimba developed this course. He is one of the most popular React instructors in the world.

React hadn’t had a major version update in over two years since React 18 was launched in 2022. With React 19, we see numerous features that simplify handling data mutations while providing APIs to enhance the user experience with optimistic updates. These updates aim to make applications faster and more responsive, even when performing complex data operations. Additionally, the React team has unveiled a new open-source compiler they've been developing for years, designed to manage many performance-related details behind the scenes, allowing developers to focus more on building features and less on optimization.

## Course Overview

Join us in this comprehensive course where we delve into the latest and greatest features of React 19. The course is structured to provide both a refresher on important concepts from React 18 and in-depth coverage of the new features in React 19. Here's what you'll learn:

### Transitions (Refresher from React 18)

We begin with a quick refresher on transitions, a key feature introduced in React 18 that helps manage UI updates more smoothly.

### React Compiler

Learn about the new React Compiler, a powerful tool designed to handle performance optimizations automatically, allowing developers to write cleaner and more efficient code.

### Form Actions

Explore the new form action features that simplify managing form states and handling user interactions more effectively.

### `useActionState()`

Understand how to use the new `useActionState()` hook to manage the state of asynchronous actions in a more intuitive way. This part is divided into three sections for a thorough exploration.

### Handling Errors in Actions

Get to grips with improved error handling techniques in actions to create more robust applications.

### `useOptimistic()`

Discover how the `useOptimistic()` hook allows you to implement optimistic UI updates, providing a better user experience by reflecting changes immediately while awaiting server confirmation.

### `useFormStatus`

Learn how to track the status of forms more effectively with the new `useFormStatus` hook.

### Refs as Props

Understand the new approach to using refs as props, which enhances component interaction and manipulation.

### `use()`

Dive into the `use()` API, a new addition that further simplifies managing asynchronous code in your React applications.

### Miscellaneous Improvements

We'll also cover other miscellaneous improvements, such as enhanced support for meta tags, which contribute to a smoother and more efficient development experience.
