In a monolithic architecture, all components of an application—such as the user interface, business logic, and data layer—are interconnected within a single codebase.

This approach simplifies deployment and can be easier to start with, but it also has limitations.

As applications grow, a monolithic structure can become unwieldy, making it challenging to update or scale specific parts without affecting the entire system.

For instance, updating one feature in a monolithic application may require testing and redeploying the entire application, increasing both the time and potential risks involved.

Microservices, on the other hand, embrace a decentralized architecture, where each service can evolve independently.

This is ideal for complex applications where different teams can develop, test, and deploy their components independently.

But microservices do introduce additional complexity, such as managing service-to-service communication, handling data consistency across distributed services, and maintaining overall system security.

Despite these challenges, microservices offer a more modular, scalable approach that fits well with modern development and deployment practices, especially in agile and DevOps environments.

So to summarize, here are the key differences:

::: tabs

@tab:active 1. Structure

- **Monolithic:** All functionalities are tightly integrated and managed within a single codebase. The application is usually deployed as a single unit.
- **Microservices:** The application is divided into multiple services, each with its own codebase, data storage, and deployment lifecycle.

@tab 2. Deployment

- **Monolithic:** Any change requires redeploying the entire application. This can lead to longer deployment cycles and higher risk of introducing bugs.
- **Microservices:** Services can be deployed independently, allowing for more frequent updates and easier rollback in case of issues.

@tab 3. Scalability

- **Monolithic:** Scaling requires scaling the entire application, which can be resource-intensive and inefficient.
- **Microservices:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on their specific load and requirements, leading to more efficient resource utilization.

@tab 4. Development and Maintenance

- **Monolithic:** A single codebase can become large and complex, making it difficult to maintain and understand. Development can become slower as the codebase grows.
- **Microservices:** Each service is smaller and more focused, making it easier to manage and develop. Teams can work on different services simultaneously without interfering with each other.

@tab 5. Fault Isolation

- **Monolithic:** A failure in one part of the application can affect the entire system.
- **Microservices:** Failures in one service do not necessarily impact other services, improving the overall fault tolerance of the system.
