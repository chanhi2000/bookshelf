No matter how optimized your JavaScript code is, it can't match native methods. This is because native methods are written in low-level languages (C/C++) and compiled into machine code, becoming part of the browser. When native methods are available, try to use them, especially for mathematical operations and DOM manipulations.

## Example: String Replacement (Native vs. Custom)

A common pitfall is rewriting native string methods like `replaceAll()`. Below is an inefficient custom implementation versus the native method, with performance benchmarks:

```js :collapsed-lines
// Inefficient custom global replacement (manual loop)  
function customReplaceAll(str, oldSubstr, newSubstr) {  
  let result = '';  
  let index = 0;  
  while (index < str.length) {  
    if (str.slice(index, index + oldSubstr.length) === oldSubstr) {  
      result += newSubstr;  
      index += oldSubstr.length;  
    } else {  
      result += str[index];  
      index++;  
    }  
  }  
  return result;  
}  

// Efficient native method (browser-optimized)  
function nativeReplaceAll(str, oldSubstr, newSubstr) {  
  return str.replaceAll(oldSubstr, newSubstr);  
}  

// Test with a large string (100,000 repetitions of "abc ")  
const largeString = 'abc '.repeat(100000);  

// Benchmark: Custom implementation  
console.time('customReplaceAll');  
customReplaceAll(largeString, 'abc', 'xyz');  
console.timeEnd('customReplaceAll'); // Output: ~5ms (varies by browser)  

// Benchmark: Native method  
console.time('nativeReplaceAll');  
nativeReplaceAll(largeString, 'abc', 'xyz');  
console.timeEnd('nativeReplaceAll'); // Output: ~2ms (typically 2-3x faster)
```

::: important Key takeaways:

- **Performance**: Native methods like `replaceAll()` are optimized at the browser level, often outperforming handwritten code (as shown in the benchmark above).
- **Maintainability**: Native methods are standardized, well-documented, and less error-prone than custom logic (for example, handling edge cases like overlapping substrings).
- **Ecosystem compatibility**: Using native methods ensures consistency with libraries and tools that rely on JavaScript’s built-in behavior.

## When to Use Custom Code

While native methods are usually superior, there are rare cases where you might need custom logic:

- When the native method doesn’t exist (for example, polyfilling for older browsers).
- For highly specialized edge cases not covered by native APIs.
- When you need to avoid function call overhead in extremely performance-critical loops (for example, tight numerical computations).

::: note Remember

Browser vendors spend millions of hours optimizing native methods. By leveraging them, you gain free performance boosts and reduce the risk of reinventing flawed solutions.
