According to the browser compatibility table of the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-firefox"/>official MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*#browser_compatibility), the CSS variables feature is widely available in all popular browser versions released after April 2017. More specifically, browsers released this feature with the following versions:

- Google Chrome 49 (Released 2 March 2016)
- Microsoft Edge 15 (Released 5 April 2017)
- Mozilla Firefox 31 (Released 22 July 2014)
- Apple Safari 9.1 (Released 21 March 2016)

According to these statistics, using custom properties in production apps is possible since most users nowadays use up-to-date web browsers. However, it would be prudent to analyze your audience’s browser versions before using any new native CSS feature.
