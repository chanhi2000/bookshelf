When building a React Native app, choosing the right UI components can dramatically speed up development and ensure a polished, platform‐consistent design. This is where React Native UI libraries come in — they provide pre-built, ready-to-use UI elements like buttons, input fields, and modals, helping developers create beautiful and functional interfaces without starting from scratch.

![The 10 Best React Native Component Libraries You Should Know](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-react-native-ui-component-libraries/banner.png)

Unlike general component libraries, which may include utilities for animations, forms, or other functionalities, UI libraries focus specifically on visual components that align with platform design guidelines. Popular options like glustack (formerly NativeBase) and React Native UI Kitten offer customizable, production-ready UI kits that streamline the development process.

In this article, we’ll explore the 10 best React Native UI libraries — comparing features, theming support, and use cases — to help you choose the right tools for your next project.

## Why use a UI library in React Native?

React Native UI libraries offer predeveloped components that help accelerate project delivery. For example, developers can [**create icon buttons with react-native-vector-icons**](/blog.logrocket.com/react-native-vector-icons-fonts-react-native-app-ui.md). Using a UI library with a complete UI kit eliminates the need to write custom styles for built-in UI elements or install multiple third-party components. UI libraries typically provide a collection of customizable UI elements for building modern apps.

With so many great options available, choosing the right React Native UI library can be challenging. However, understanding each library’s components, features, limitations, and developer support makes it easier to select one based on your design goals.

## React Native Paper

[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) is a cross-platform React Native UI library that is based on Google’s Material Design. Developed by the official React Native development partner [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`callstack`](https://github.com/callstack), React Native Paper has theming support and offers customizable and production-ready components.

![React Native Paper UI](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-react-native-ui-component-libraries/react-native-paper-ui.png)

When using this React Native UI library, you can reduce its bundle size by using a [Babel plugin (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`satya164/babel-plugin-optional-require`)](https://github.com/satya164/babel-plugin-optional-require) that allows you to optionally require modules. This will exclude all the modules that your app doesn’t use and rewrite the import statements to include only those that are imported in the app’s component files. React Native Paper also supports web using [**React Native Web**](/blog.logrocket.com/sharing-code-react-native-web.md).

How do you use React Native Paper themes? Applying themes to a particular component is easy; React Native Paper comes with two default themes, namely `light` and `dark`, which you can extend. It uses the [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`oblador/react-native-vector-icons`](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library to support and use icons correctly in buttons, floating action buttons, lists, and more.

## React Native Elements

One of the oldest and easiest libraries to start with, [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/) is a cross-platform UI library that implements Material Design. Instead of following an opinionated design system, this toolkit offers a more basic structure through its generalized inbuilt components, meaning you’ll have [**more control over how you want to customize components**](/blog.logrocket.com/react-native-styling-tutorial-with-examples.md). Customization of any component in this library will include a mixture of some custom props, as well as props from the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-react"/>React Native core API](https://reactnative.dev/).

![React Native Elements UI Example](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-react-native-ui-component-libraries/react-native-elements-ui-example.png)

That being said, when using this React Native UI library, I’ve found that I can write much less boilerplate code than I do when using some of the other libraries covered in this post. The applications built using this UI toolkit also look and feel universal across both iOS and Android platforms.

`ThemeProvider` offers support for theming. Unlike [**some of the other libraries**](/blog.logrocket.com/which-ui-libraries-support-dark-mode.md), which give you both light and dark themes, you’ll have to define your themes to make them work with React Native Elements. You can also use React Native Elements in web projects by using React Native Web.

## UI library vs. component library: What’s the difference?

When discussing UI development in React Native, it’s important to differentiate between a UI library and a component library, as these terms are often used interchangeably.

A UI library in React Native provides a set of prebuilt, ready-to-use components that help developers build apps faster. Instead of creating UI elements like buttons, input fields, or modals from scratch, developers get fully designed and functional components that follow platform-specific styles. This saves time and ensures a consistent app design.

A component library, on the other hand, is a broader category. It includes UI libraries but also encompasses UI kits, form builders, and specialized tools for handling animations, charts, or drag-and-drop interfaces. Examples include libraries for animations, charts, or drag-and-drop interfaces.

Some great examples of React Native UI libraries are NativeBase and UI Kitten, while libraries like Lottie and Tamagui better fit the component library description.

## What is the best React Native component library?

The best React Native component library depends on your specific project needs. When multiple component libraries meet your design or development requirements, selecting one with strong developer support, an active development timeline, and comprehensive documentation is key.

All the component libraries in this list are actively maintained and are designed to speed up development by providing efficient, ready-to-use components. As long as you have a clear vision for your UI design, any of these libraries should work well.

You can find more third-party, open source UI component libraries in the [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`jondot/awesome-react-native`](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native#ui) GitHub repository.
