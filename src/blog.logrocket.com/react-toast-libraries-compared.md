![Comparing The Top React Toast Libraries](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/react-toast-libraries-compared/banner.png)

In app development, it’s common to show important messages to users based on their actions or conditions. Toast notifications are a great way to do this because they’re lightweight and don’t disrupt the user experience.

While you can [**create your own custom React toast notifications**](/blog.logrocket.com/how-to-create-a-custom-toast-component-with-react.md), using a pre-built library with a wide range of features and customization saves you time and effort.

In this article, we’ll learn about toast notifications, understand their significance, and compare some of the most popular React toast libraries. We will delve into their features and benefits, so you can choose the best option for your project.

## What are toast notifications?

Toast notifications are a type of UI element commonly used in app development, including React applications. They are used to display brief, unobtrusive messages or notifications to users. These messages typically appear on the screen for a short period of time and then disappear, similar to how a slice of toast pops up from a toaster and then disappears.

The significance of toast notifications in React and other app development contexts lies in their ability to effectively communicate important information to users without disrupting their overall experience. Here are some key points highlighting the importance of toast notifications:

- **Non-intrusive**: Toast notifications are designed to be non-disruptive. They appear briefly at the top, bottom, or any other designated corner of the screen, without taking over the entire interface. This design approach ensures users can quickly notice them with minimal distraction
- **Real-time feedback**: Toast notifications provide real-time feedback to users about their actions or system events. For example, they can notify users of successful form submissions, errors, new messages, or updates
- **User engagement**: Toast notifications help maintain user engagement by promptly informing users of relevant information or actions they need to take, enhancing the overall user experience
- **User-friendliness**: By offering a consistent and user-friendly way to convey messages, toast notifications contribute to a more intuitive and user-friendly app interface

### Criteria for comparing React toast libraries

Given that React is the most popular choice for app development, there is a wide range of options available for implementing toast notifications. In the rest of this article, we will list and compare a number of popular React toast libraries that offer a diverse set of features and customization options.

We will compare these React libraries based on their features, usage, variants, configuration and style options, and the developer experience they provide. Each library comes with a working demonstration to help you kickstart the implementation. At the ed, we will rank these libraries based on this criteria.

@tab Usage

Setting up basic toast notifications with React Hot Toast is straightforward. The library provides a range of methods through its toast API, such as `success()`, `error()`, and more, to handle different toast variations.

The `Toaster` component serves as the container for all toast messages and is responsible for rendering them through the API. Here’s how simple it is to display a simple toast message using the API. Just pass the message as an argument to the `toast()` method and attach it to the event modifier of a triggering element:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import toast, { Toaster } from "react-hot-toast";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button 
        onClick={() => toast("This is a simple toast.")}>Show Toast</button>
      <Toaster />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

@tab Variants

React Hot Toast offers five different toast variants: `success`, `error`, `loading`, `custom`, and `promise`. The `success`, `error`, and `loading` methods are used to show toast variations with a success message, an error message, or a message with a loading spinner icon, respectively:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import toast, { Toaster } from "react-hot-toast";

const successToast = () => toast.success("Success toast.");
const errorToast = () => toast.error("Error toast.");
const loadingToast = () => toast.loading("Loading toast...");

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={successToast}>Show Success Toast</button>
      <button onClick={errorToast}>Show Error Toast</button>
      <button onClick={loadingToast}>Show Loading Toast</button>
      <Toaster />
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The `toast.promise()` method is useful when you want to update a toast after a promise has been resolved or rejected, such as after fetching data from an API has been completed. Below is a quick example to demonstrate this:

```jsx :collapsed-lines title="App.jsx"
import {useState} from 'react';
import toast, { Toaster } from "react-hot-toast";

const fetchData = async() => { ... }

const App = () => {
  const [title, setTitle] = useState("");
  const [body, setBody] = useState("");

  const promiseToast = async () => {
    toast.promise(fetchData(), {
      loading: "Fetching data",
      success: (data) => {
        setBody(data.body);
        return "Data fetched successfully.";
      },
      error: (error) => {
        return error.message; // Return the error message
      }
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>
        Click the following buttons to initiate different types of toast
        messages generated using React Hot Toasts library.
      </p>
      <div className="btn-group">
        <button onClick={successToast}>Success</button>
        <button onClick={errorToast}>Error</button>
        <button onClick={loadingToast}>Loading</button>
        <button onClick={promiseToast}>Promise</button>
        <button onClick={customToast}>Custom</button>
      </div>
      {body && (
        <div className="post">
          <h1>Text loaded with a fetch request</h1>
          <p>{body}</p>
        </div>
      )}
      <Toaster />
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

@tab Configuration

The second argument of the `toast` method is an `options` object that allows you to customize the behavior of each toast. You can specify the toast’s duration, alter its style, provide custom icons from an icon library, define its accessibility properties, and modify the theme of its icon:

```jsx
import { AiFillAndroid } from "react-icons/ai";

toast.error("error toast", {
  duration: 7000,

  //icon config
  iconTheme: {
    primary: "white",
    secondary: "black",
  },

  //ARIA config
  role: "status",
  ariaLive: "polite",

  //toast styles
  style: {
    background: "red",
    color: "whitesmoke",
    icon: <AiFillAndroid />,
  },
});
```

There are different ways to dismiss toasts with the React Hot Toast library. You can dismiss a single toast individually by using the `toast.dismiss()` method and passing the reference to the toast you want to close as an argument. If you don’t pass a specific toast reference to the `dismiss` method, it will dismiss all toasts simultaneously:

```jsx
const successToast = toast.success('This is a successt toast');
toast.dismiss(successToast);

toast.dismiss() // this will dismiss all toasts at once 
```

@tab Developer experience

React Hot Toast offer simple yet extensive customization options that allow you to tailor your toasts based on your project’s requirements.

In addition to its high customizability, React Hot Toast also has [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>well-structured documentation](https://react-hot-toast.com/docs), which provides more information about API usage, other components like `Toaster` and `ToastBar`, custom hook creation, and the internal API state, which is definitely worth exploring.

## NotiStack

The [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>NotiStack](https://notistack.com/) library refers to the notifications it generates as “snackbars,” a term particularly fitting for mobile app contexts. However, the library offers a wide array of customization options, granting you the flexibility to decide whether to maintain the toast-like behavior for your notifications or elevate them further to full-fledged snackbars.

NotiStack excels in performance, efficiently handling numerous on-screen notifications, making it perfect for chat apps or social media apps. Its flexibility allows it to display a variety of notifications, with customization options for positioning, style, and animation:

![NotiStack Notifications](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/react-toast-libraries-compared/notistack-notifications.png)

::: tabs

@tab:active Features

- **Highly customizable:** You can control the appearance, position, and behavior of your notifications.
- **Material UI**: NotiStack works great with apps using Material UI, as it’s designed specifically for use with it
- **Stackable notifications:** Notifications can be stacked on top of one another, so you can display multiple notification messages at the same time
- **Smooth transitions:** Notifications are displayed with smooth transitions, making them more visually appealing
- **Well-documented:** The library is well-documented and easy to get started with
- **Supports multiple environments:** NotiStack supports multiple environments, including React Native and Next.js
- **Supports TypeScript**

@tab Usage

To use NotiStack, you first need to import the `useNotistack` Hook and the `Notifier` component from the library. Then, you can use the `useNotistack` Hook to get a reference to the NotiStack instance. This instance can be used to display notifications, close notifications, and manage the notification queue.

To display a notification, you can use the `enqueueSnackbar` method of the Notistack instance. This method tasks an object as a parameter, which contains the properties of the notification. The following code shows how to display a simple text notification:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { useNotistack } from 'notistack';

const App = () => {
  const notistack = useNotistack();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => notistack.enqueueSnackbar('This is a notification.')}>
      Display notification
    </button>
  );
};
```

You can also use the `enqueueSnackbar` method to display more complex notifications, such as notifications with alerts or modals. For example, the following code shows how to display a notification with an alert:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { useNotistack } from 'notistack';

const App = () => {
  const notistack = useNotistack();

  return (
    <button onClick={() => notistack.enqueueSnackbar('This is a notification with an alert.', {
      variant: 'error',
      action: (key) => {
        // Do something when the user clicks the action button.
      },
    })}>
      Display notification
    </button>
  );
};
```

@tab Variants

NotiStack supports a variety of notification variants, which can be used to change the appearance of the notification, including notifications for success, info, warning, error, and the default one. The example below covers the implementation of each of the variants:

```jsx :collapsed-lines title="App.jsx"
import { SnackbarProvider, useSnackbar } from "notistack";

const App = () => {
  const { enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar();

  const showSnackbar = (variant) => {
    enqueueSnackbar(`This is a ${variant} snackbar!`, {
      variant: variant,
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => showSnackbar("success")}>Show Success Snackbar</button>
      <button onClick={() => showSnackbar("info")}>Show Info Snackbar</button>
      <button onClick={() => showSnackbar("warning")}>Show Warning Snackbar</button>
      <button onClick={() => showSnackbar("error")}>Show Error Snackbar</button>
      <button onClick={() => showSnackbar("default")}>Show Default Snackbar</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

@tab Configuration options

NotiStack provides versatile configuration options for notifications, applied globally via `SnackbarProvider` or individually with `enqueueSnackbar()`. Global settings standardize behavior and appearance. For example, `anchorOrigin` controls position, `autoHideDuration` sets display time, and `maxSnackbars` limits concurrent notifications:

```jsx :collapsed-lines title="App.jsx"
import { SnackbarProvider, useSnackbar } from 'notistack';

const App = () => {
  const { enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar();

  return (
    <SnackbarProvider
      anchorOrigin={{ vertical: 'top', horizontal: 'right' }}
      autoHideDuration={3000}
      maxSnack={3} // Updated to maxSnack
    >
      <button onClick={() => enqueueSnackbar('This is a notification!')}>
        Show notification
      </button>
    </SnackbarProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

For specific notifications, customize with options like `action`, `anchorOrigin`, and `autoHideDuration`. Use `dense` to adjust the size for smaller screens and control animations through `transition`:

```jsx :collapsed-lines title="App.jsx"
import { SnackbarProvider, useSnackbar } from 'notistack';

const App = () => {
  const { enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar();

  const showCustomSnackbar = () => {
    enqueueSnackbar('This is a custom notification!', {
      anchorOrigin: { vertical: 'bottom', horizontal: 'left' },
      autoHideDuration: 5000,
      dense: true,
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={showCustomSnackbar}>Show custom notification</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

@tab Developer experience

The NotiStack library offers an uncomplicated and user-friendly API, facilitating an easy start. It features comprehensive documentation, complete with examples and tutorials, and is actively developed and maintained to address feedback and bug reports.

Here’s a quick demo for using the NotiStack library:

## React-Toastify

[React-Toastify (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`fkhadra/react-toastify`)](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) offers unique features such as enhanced customization, bidirectional (RTL) language support, and additional mobile interactions.

These features empower users to finely customize animations, positions, and durations; display notifications in different languages; and enable actions such as swiping to dismiss and tapping to open:

![React-Toastify Notifications](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/react-toast-libraries-compared/React-Toastify-notifications.png)

::: tabs

@tab:active Features

- **Lightweight**: React-Toastify is nearly three times in terms of file size comparatively, which is basically 16KB minified and gzipped, which is not too much
- **Highly customizable**: The library provides excellent control over the appearance, position, and behavior of your toast notifications
- **Multi-variant**: You can create various types of messages, such as success messages, error messages, warnings, and more
- **RTL support**: React-Toastify offers support for right-to-left languages, making it suitable for internationalized apps
- **Swipe to close**: Users can easily swipe to close the notifications
- **Animated toasts**: You can add an interactive and visually appealing touch to your toast notifications by applying different animations
- **Custom hooks**: Use custom hooks to create even more complex toast notifications
- **Supports TypeScript**

@tab Usage

React-Toastify has a similar API to React Hot Toast that provides a `toast` method to access the different toast variants. The `ToastContainer` component is required to contain and render the toast notifications:

```jsx
import { ToastContainer, toast } from "react-toastify";
import "react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css";

const App = () => {
  const successToast = () => toast.success("This is a success toast!");
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button onClick={successToast}>show success toast</button>
      <ToastContainer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

@tab Variants

React-Toastify offers six toast variants: `success`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `dark`, along with a default variant, all of which are self-explanatory. The following code shows their straightforward implementation in a React component:

```jsx :collapsed-lines title="App.jsx"
import { toast } from "react-toastify";
import "react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => toast.success("Success toast")}>
        Show Success Toast
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => toast.error("Error toast")}>
        Show Error Toast
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => toast.warning("Warning toast")}>
        Show Warning Toast
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => toast.info("Info toast")}>Show Info Toast</button>
      <button onClick={() => toast.dark("Dark mode toast")}>
        Show Dark Mode Toast
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => toast("Default toast")}>Show Default Toast</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The dark-mode-powered toast sets the Toastify library apart from others in terms of toast UI and styling, providing you with an easy way to integrate it with your app’s dark mode.

@tab Configuration

Similar to React Hot Toast, we can pass an `options` object as the second argument to a React-Toastify `toast` to define different behaviors for it:

```jsx
toast.dark("This is a success toast!", {
  position: toast.POSITION.BOTTOM_RIGHT,
  autoClose: 2000,
  pauseOnHover: true,
  draggable: true,
});
```

Additionally, we have the option to customize the default toast animation using the `cssTransition` method, which accepts an object where we can specify the `enter` and `exit` animations for the toast:

```jsx
import "animate.css/animate.min.css";
import { ToastContainer, toast, cssTransition } from "react-toastify";

const bounce = cssTransition({
  enter: "animate__animated animate__bounceIn",
  exit: "animate__animated animate__bounceOut",
});

const customAnimationToast = () => {
  toast.dark("Hey 👋, see how easy!", {
    transition: bounce,
  });
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button onClick={customAnimationToast}>show bounce toast</button>
      <ToastContainer transition={bounce} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Unlike React Hot Toast, where we can store a reference to a toast in a variable, with React-Toastify, we need to use the `useRef` Hook to track the toast we want to update programmatically:

```jsx
import { useRef } from "react";

export default function App() {
  let toastId = useRef(null);

  const successToast = () => {
    toastId = toast("Fetching data...", { autoClose: false });
  };

  const updateToast = () => {
    toast.update(toastId, { type: toast.TYPE.INFO, autoClose: 5000 });
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={successToast}>show success toast</button>
      <Button onClick={updateToast}>update toast</Button>
      <ToastContainer ref={toastId} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

@tab Developer experience

React-Toastify offers a greater variety of toast styles compared to the other libraries of its kind, packed with many fantastic features. Its API shares similarities with both React Hot Toast and React Toast Notifications libraries, making it relatively easy to work with:

:::

---

## React Toast Notifications

The [React Toast Notifications (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`jossmac/react-toast-notifications`)](https://github.com/jossmac/react-toast-notifications) library shares some similarities with React Hot Toast and React-Toastify, but it stands out as the simplest option, requiring minimal setup:

![React Toast Notifications](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/react-toast-libraries-compared/react-toast-notifications.png)

::: tabs

@tab:active Features

- **Framework-agnostic**: Compatible with various JavaScript frameworks
- **Highly customizable**: Customize notifications to match your app’s design
- **Multiple Types**: Support for success, error, warning, and info notifications
- **Lightweight**: Nearly 6.3KB gzipped
- **Accessibility**: Ensures notifications are accessible to all users

@tab Usage

To use React Toast Notifications, simply wrap your app in the `ToastProvider` component, which provides context for its descendant `Toast` components:

```jsx title="index.js"
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { ToastProvider } from "react-toast-notifications";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ToastProvider>
      <App />
    </ToastProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

With the `useToast` Hook, you can use the `addToast` method. It takes two arguments: a string containing the toast message and a configuration object. Within the config object, you can specify the toast appearance as `success` and set `autoDismiss` to `true`:

```jsx :collapsed-lines title="App.jsx"
import { useToasts } from "react-toast-notifications";

export default function App() {
  const { addToast } = useToasts();
  const successToast = () => {
    addToast("This is a success toast", {
      appearance: "success",
      autoDismiss: true,
    });
  };
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <button onClick={successToast}>show success toast</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `useToast` Hook provides you with the following methods:

```jsx
const { 
  addToast, 
  removeToast, 
  removeAllToasts, 
  updateToast 
} = useToast();
```

You already know how the `addToast` method works. You can use the `removeToast` method to remove a specific toast, and the `removeAllToasts` method to remove all open toasts.

The `updateToast` method is useful when we want to update a toast after an operation has been completed, such as after some data has been fetched.

@tab Variants

In React Toast Notifications, you can create different types of toast notifications to convey various messages, such as `success`, `error`, `warning`, and `info`. These notifications are styled differently to visually represent their respective meanings.

Here’s an improved code example that demonstrates how to use these toast types:

```jsx :collapsed-lines title="App.jsx"
import { useToasts } from 'react-toast-notifications';

const App = () => {
  const { addToast } = useToasts();

  const showToast = (message, appearance) => {
    addToast(message, { appearance });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => showToast("Success toast", "success")}>
        Show Success Toast
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => showToast("Error toast", "error")}>
        Show Error Toast
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => showToast("Warning toast", "warning")}>
        Show Warning Toast
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => showToast("Info toast", "info")}>
        Show Info Toast
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Configuration

In React Toast Notifications, you can configure how toasts behave and appear by passing specific props to the `ToastProvider`. These configurations will be inherited by the descendant toast components within the provider:

```jsx
<ToastProvider 
  placement="top-center" 
  transitionDuration={2000}
  autoDismiss="true"
 autoDismissTimeout={5000}>
  <App />
</ChakraProvider>
```

When configuring `ToastProvider`, the specified props such as `placement`, `transitionDuration`, `autoDismiss`, and `autoDismissTimeout` are passed as configuration options. These options are then inherited by the descendant toast components, ensuring that all toasts created within the escape of the provider adhere to the specified configuration.

This centralized configuration simplifies the management of toast behavior and appearance across your React application.

@tab Developer experience

Although the API is straightforward, React Toast Notifications may not be an easy library to work with. The documentation is lacking, particularly in explaining how to pass a user ID to a toast and how to remove and update toast messages.

It’s worth noting that its developers have recently announced that React Toast Notifications is no longer maintained and recommend using other libraries such as React Hot Toast:

<CodePen
  user="_rahul"
  slug-hash="GRPOGOY"
  title="React Toast Notifications: A Simple Demo"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

Keep in mind that it’s slightly heavier compared to some of its alternatives and may make debugging more challenging in complex apps.

React-Toastify is a good choice for projects that demand feature-rich toast notifications with extensive customization options.

@tab NotiStack

Specifically designed for Material UI users, NotiStack seamlessly integrates with this framework. It provides both global and per-toast configuration options, supports snackbars, and offers customization for both mobile and web apps. It works seamlessly with React Native and Next.js too.

Note that it may unnecessarily increase the project’s weight (~20KB) if Material UI is not already being used, as it adds Material UI as an additional dependency.

NotiStack is an ideal solution for projects using Material UI, offering a well-integrated, customizable, and feature-rich toast/snackbar notification solution.

@tab React Toast Notifications

This minimalistic, framework-agnostic library is highly customizable and allows you to create notifications from scratch. It’s lightweight and doesn’t enforce any specific styling. However, setting it up and styling it requires more manual work. Additionally, the library is no longer maintained and doesn’t support TypeScript.

Due to its small size, React Toast Notifications may still be suitable for projects where you need complete control over notification appearance and behavior, provided you’re comfortable with more hands-on customization.

## Conclusion

After evaluating these four React toast libraries and gaining insight into their usage within our apps, I find myself favoring React Hot Toast above the others. Apart from its well-designed toasts and intuitive API, its `promise` feature simplifies a lot of the setup needed for asynchronous toast updates.

Feel free to share your favorites in the comments and also suggest other libraries you believe deserve a spot on the list.
