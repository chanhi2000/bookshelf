So, you‚Äôre a JavaScript developer? Nice to hear ‚Äî what do you think this code returns? And yeah, it‚Äôs a trick question:

```js
function returnSomething() {
  return {
    name: 'JavaScript Expert'
    contactMethod: 'Shine batsign at sky'
  }
}
```

![Stylized JavaScript logo with bold letters representing JavaScript, illuminated by a bright light from the center.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/banner.png)

In almost any other language ‚Äî C#, Java, the list goes on ‚Äî we‚Äôd get back the object with `JavaScript Expert`. And you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that in JavaScript, we‚Äôd get back the same result.

However, humor me, and pop this into your development console, and then execute the function. Almost unbelievably, it returns¬†`undefined`.

## When things don‚Äôt go to plan

Working as a software developer means that you are responsible for how your app works, whether it works well or poorly. A main constraint in that is the tools that you decide to use. If you understand what you‚Äôre using, you‚Äôll hopefully make good choices in how you design your software.

JavaScript is unique because it‚Äôs the language of choice of so many new software developers. Want to write a mobile app? Just use React Native and JavaScript. Desktop app? React Native and JavaScript. A cloud function to run somewhere? Node.js, and, you guessed it, JavaScript.

However, due to how long JavaScript has been around, it has its fair share of footguns and gotchas. Some of these range from mildly amusing to none-of-my-code-works-and-I-don‚Äôt-know-why severity.

And, even if we lived in a time when Internet Explorer 6 was in its heyday, it would simply be too late to go and try to fix some of these design decisions, as we would break too much of the web. If that were the case then, imagine if we tried today! üåçüí•

So, how does JavaScript not work in a way that we might expect? Let‚Äôs take a look.

---

## Automatic Semicolon Injection (ASI)

The example listed at the outset is accepted by JavaScript interpreters but doesn‚Äôt yield the expected result. The reason is because of Automatic Semicolon Injection.

Some languages, like C#, are dogmatic about ending each line with a semicolon. JavaScript also uses semicolons to indicate the end of a line, but the semicolon is actually optional. By optional, it means that JavaScript will apply a set of complex rules to [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>work out whether a semicolon should have gone there or not](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JavaScript/Automatic_semicolon_insertion).

In the example at the outset, because the opening bracket doesn‚Äôt occur on the same line as the `return`, ASI pops one in there for us. So, as far as JavaScript is concerned, our code actually looks like this:

```js
function returnSomething() {
  return ; // <-- semicolon inserted by ASI, remainder of function not evaluated.
    {
      name: 'JavaScript Expert'
      contactMethod: 'Shine batsign at sky'
    }
}
```

The way to avoid this is to have the opening bracket on the same line as a return. And, while semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript, it‚Äôs going to hurt you in the long run to work with that concept.

If you have an interview, and you have to write JS, and you write it without semicolons based on the rationale ‚Äúbut they‚Äôre optional,‚Äù there‚Äôs going to be a lot of paper shuffling and chuckling. Just don‚Äôt do it.

---

## Arrays with non-sequential keys

Let‚Äôs imagine we have a simple array:

```js
var array = [];
```

We know we can pop, push, append, and do whatever we like with arrays. But we also know that JavaScript, like other languages, lets us access array elements by index.

However, what‚Äôs unusual about JavaScript is that you can also *set* elements by array index when the array isn‚Äôt even up to that index just yet:

```js
array[0] = "first element";
array[1] = "second element";
array[100] = "wait what?";
```

I‚Äôve got a good question for you though ‚Äî what‚Äôs the length of an array when you‚Äôve only set three elements? Possibly non-intuitively, it‚Äôs 101. On one hand, it‚Äôs reasonable that array items 2 through 99 are `undefined`, but on the other, we only set three objects, not 100. **Why does it matter?**

Maybe your eyes roll out of your head and you say, ‚ÄúOK Lewis, you‚Äôre manually assigning items into an array and watching the wheels come off; that makes you weird, not JavaScript.‚Äù

I would understand that position. But imagine for a moment you‚Äôre doing something in a nested for loop, and you choose the wrong iterator or make a bunk calculation.

At some point, the thought process of ‚Äúwhy am I getting expected result, expected result, `undefined`, expected result‚Äù is going to turn to madness, and soon enough to tears! Little did you know your array magically grew to accommodate what you were trying to do.

The only problem was, you were trying to do the wrong thing.

Compared to another language, like C# (for no particular reason), arrays are of fixed length. When you create an array, you have to define a length. Even for other dynamic collection objects, like `List<T>`, you can‚Äôt assign into an undefined index. So, if your nested loop attempts to write to a previously unassigned index, your program will throw.

Exceptions aren‚Äôt nice, but it‚Äôs probably the right thing to do. I mean, did you otherwise mean to create a Swiss cheese array? Does anyone mean to do that? Hopefully not.

![Image of Swiss cheese used to symbolize the gaps in a JavaScript array when non-sequential keys are assigned.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/swiss-cheese-javascript-array.jpg)

It‚Äôs only Swiss cheese arrays if the developers are from Switzerland. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just sparkling bad programming.

## Adding properties to primatives are ignored

We know that in JavaScript we can assign new functions to prototypes. So, we can give strings or arrays ‚ú®special powers‚ú®. Of course, doing so is terrible practice because it means that our `string` prototype will behave differently to others, which already causes untold heartache for many a developer.

So, we can do this for example:

```js
String.prototype.alwaysReturnsFalse = () => false;
```

And then we can create a string object:

```js
var itsAString = "hooray";
itsAString.alwaysReturnsFalse();
```

And it would return `false`.

It‚Äôs cute we can always just randomly jam our functions into the factory-defined implementation of how a `string` can act.

Sure, all those good people broke their backs and spent tens of thousands of hours defining JavaScript in the [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>TC39 specification](https://tc39.es/), but don‚Äôt let that dissuade you from banging in your random functions as you see fit.

If we‚Äôre not happy with that particular brand of pain, we can also randomly assign new functions to complex objects as we want to, ensuring that our code will be a very particular form of nonsense, understood only by yourself and God:

![Screenshot showing JavaScript code where a function is added to an object and returns false when called.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-add-function-to-object.png)

Composing our objects like this is naturally a terrible idea, but as we are committed to this treachery, JavaScript obliges us in our request. Our `testObject` takes on the new function we‚Äôve thrown into it.

However, the good will runs out with object primatives, in a surprising way:

![Screenshot showing an attempt to add a function to a string primitive in JavaScript, resulting in a TypeError: not a function.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-typeerror-primitive-property.png)

The interpreter acknowledges our attempt to assign a function into the string primative. It even echoes the function back to us. But then, when we attempt to call it, we get a `TypeError: testString.onlyFalse is not a function`. If it‚Äôs not possible to do this, typically you would expect this to throw on assignation, not on function call.

**Why does it matter?**

For better or for worse, JavaScript is a highly flexible and dynamic language. This flexibility allows us to compose functionality that‚Äôs not possible in other languages. If something hasn‚Äôt worked, then we should expect an exception. JavaScript taking this awkward command and being like ‚Äúuh, OK‚Äù and then forgetting about it changes this fundamental expectation.

## Type coercion

In other strongly typed languages, we have to define the type of the data that we‚Äôre storing before we‚Äôre able to store it. JavaScript doesn‚Äôt have this same kind of limitation, and it will happily nudge objects away from their defined type to try to get them to play nice together.

On one hand, it gets us away from casting variables back and forth to their respective types. So it‚Äôs convenient:

![Screenshot showing JavaScript loose equality comparison between a string "1234" and a number 1234, which evaluates to true.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-loose-equality-type-coercion.png)

Thanks for saving me from a Number(x) call!

It‚Äôs even the same for booleans:

![Screenshot showing JavaScript loose equality comparison where true is equal to 1, which evaluates to true.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-loose-equality-boolean.png)

I mean, I guess‚Ä¶

This approach is completely sane and valid until we want to involve ourselves in the taboo ritual known as ‚Äúaddition.‚Äù When we try to add `"1"` and `1` together, what happens? What way does the type coercion go?

![Screenshot showing JavaScript type coercion where "1" + 1 results in the string '11'.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-string-number-coercion.png)

The ~insanity~ hilarity multiplies when we bring `bool` to the party:

![Screenshot showing JavaScript addition of true + true, which evaluates to 2.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-boolean-addition-true.png)

Oh ‚Äî is it because a `bool` is somehow a `number` under the hood?

![Screenshot showing JavaScript typeof operation on true, which returns 'boolean'.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-typeof-boolean.png)

Nope. It‚Äôs a boolean. JavaScript is shaving off the pesky edges of the square to fit it into that round hole because reasons.

**Why does it matter?**

When you‚Äôre doing something as basic as adding numbers together, having results vary can create some weird bugs. It‚Äôs a good reminder to stick to the triple equals (===) when making comparisons, as zapping between types may not give you the intended result.

---

## Function hoisting

With languages that we use today, an important aspect is something called ‚Äúfunction hoisting.‚Äù Essentially, it means that you can write your functions in your file wherever you like, and you‚Äôll be able to call them before the functions are declared:

```js
foo();

function foo(){
  console.log("test");
}
```

It‚Äôs handy because we don‚Äôt have to manually reorder our code to make it work.

But, there‚Äôs more than one way to describe a function. In this example, we used a function declaration to do so. We can also use a function expression:

```js
foo(); //TypeError: foo is not a function!

var foo = function() {
  console.log("test");
}
```

**Why does it matter?**

There‚Äôs not a huge difference between declaring functions in either case, but if you choose the wrong one, you won‚Äôt be able to call your function unless you‚Äôre calling it after you‚Äôve declared it.

## Null is an object

Within other languages, object properties can be assigned, or they can be `null`. `null` indicates that the property is not assigned. It‚Äôs simple to equate in our heads ‚Äî there‚Äôs either an object there, or it‚Äôs `null`. We can also assign properties back to `null` if we so wish.

JavaScript complicates this landscape by having `null` and also `undefined`. But it‚Äôs all the same, right? You either have a ball in your hand, or you don‚Äôt.

Unsurprisingly, it‚Äôs not all the same. In JavaScript, `null` indicates the intentional lack of a value, whereas `undefined` indicates the implied lack of a value. So, whether it‚Äôs intentional, explicit, or written in the sky, the fact is that a no value = no value, right?

Again, unfortunately, that‚Äôs not how the equation works out.

Well, what‚Äôs the type of `undefined`?

![Screenshot showing the JavaScript typeof operation on undefined, which returns 'undefined'.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-typeof-undefined.png)

Okay, and what‚Äôs the type of `null`?

![Screenshot showing JavaScript typeof operation on null, which returns 'object'.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-typeof-null-object.png)

ü§Ø it‚Äôs an object*.* So in JavaScript, the type of a complex object and `null` are the same ‚Äî they‚Äôre both `object`:

![Screenshot showing JavaScript code where a variable is assigned an object and the typeof operation returns 'object'.](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/six-things-you-may-not-know-about-javascript/javascript-complex-object-testing.png)

**Why does it matter?**

JavaScript doesn‚Äôt have a robust type-checking system built in, and there‚Äôs only a handful of primative types to choose from. So, using `typeof` to understand what‚Äôs in our variable can become tricky. If our variable holds a valid object, then we‚Äôd get `object`. But if it‚Äôs `null`, we‚Äôd still get `object`. It‚Äôs counter-intuitive to think that a null reference is an object.

---

## Conclusion

There‚Äôs no questioning of JavaScript‚Äôs immense popularity today as a language. As time continues and other ecosystems such as npm continue to host huge numbers of packages, JavaScript will only continue increasing in popularity.

But what‚Äôs done is done. No matter how weird it is that `null` is an `object`, or that JavaScript will pop semicolons in where it sees fit, these systems will probably never be deprecated, changed, or removed. Anecdotally, I would say that if Automatic Semicolon Injection was turned off overnight, it‚Äôd probably cause a bigger global outage than the CrowdStrike update would.

Certainly, changing one of these would wreak havoc on the web. It‚Äôs actually safer, and probably more practical, to make the developers aware of these particular language quirks than to actually go back and resolve the original problems.

So, go and make good choices, and don‚Äôt forget to use semicolons!
