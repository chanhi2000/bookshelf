According to the [release notes (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`tannerlinsley/react-table`)](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/releases/tag/v7.0.0), React Table 7 introduced the following features to the library:

- Auto out of the box, fully controllable API
- Sorting (multi and stable)
- Filters
- Pivoting and aggregation
- Row selection and expansion
- Column ordering
- Server-side/controlled data/state

The changes and new features in the latest release are meant to make React Table more:

- Lightweight (5kb-14kb+, depending on features used and tree-shaking)
- Headless (100 percent customizable, bring-your-own-UI)
- Animatable
- Virtualizable
- Resizable
- Extensible (via a new Hooks-based plugin system)

As mentioned above, the most recent minor release of `react-table` is [React Table v7.6.3 (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-npm"/>`react-table`)](https://npmjs.com/package/react-table?activeTab=versions), released on Jan. 11, 2021. Head to npm for a full [version history of React Table (<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-npm"/>`react-table`)](https://npmjs.com/package/react-table?activeTab=versions).
