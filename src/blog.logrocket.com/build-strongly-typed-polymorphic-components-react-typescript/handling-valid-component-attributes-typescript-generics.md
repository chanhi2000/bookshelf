In solving this second use case, you‚Äôll come to appreciate how powerful generics truly are. First, let‚Äôs understand what we‚Äôre trying to accomplish here.

Once we receive a generic `as` type, we want to make sure that the remaining props passed to our component are relevant, based on the `as` prop.

So, for example, if a user passed in an `as` prop of `img`, we‚Äôd want `href` to equally be a valid prop!

![As Prop And Href](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/as-prop-and-href.png)

To give you a sense of how we‚Äôd accomplish this, take a look at the current state of our solution:

```tsx
export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType>({
  as,
  children,
}: {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

The prop of this component is now represented by the object type:

```tsx
{
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

In pseudocode, what we‚Äôd like would be the following:

```tsx
{
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
} & {
  ...otherValidPropsBasedOnTheValueOfAs
}
```

![Pseudocode](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/pseudocode.png)

This requirement is enough to leave one grasping at straws. We can‚Äôt possibly write a function that determines appropriate types based on the value of `as`, and it‚Äôs not smart to list out a union type manually.

Well, what if there was a provided type from `React` that acted as a ‚Äúfunction‚Äù that‚Äôll return valid element types based on what you pass it?

Before introducing the solution, let‚Äôs have a bit of a refactor. Let‚Äôs pull out the props of the component into a separate type:

```tsx
// üëá See TextProps pulled out below 
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
} 

export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType>({
  as,
  children,
}: TextProps<C>) => { // üëà see TextProps used 
  const Component = as || "span";
  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

What‚Äôs important here is to note how the generic is passed on to `TextProps<C>`. Similar to a function call in JavaScript ‚Äî but with angle braces.

The magic wand here is to leverage the `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef` type as shown below:

```tsx
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>; // üëà look here 

export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType>({
  as,
  children,
}: TextProps<C>) => {
  const Component = as || "span";
  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

Note that we‚Äôre introducing an intersection here. Essentially, we‚Äôre saying, the type of `TextProps` is an object type containing `as`, `children`, and some other types represented by `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`.

![`React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/react-componentpropswithoutref.png)

If you read the code, it perhaps becomes apparent what‚Äôs going on here.

Based on the type of `as`, represented by the generic `C`, `React.componentPropsWithoutRef` will return valid component props that correlate with the string attribute passed to the `as` prop.

There‚Äôs one more significant point to note.

![Different `ComponentProps` Type Variants](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/different-componentprops-type-variants.png)

If you just started typing and rely on IntelliSense from your editor, you‚Äôd realize there are three variants of the `React.ComponentProps...` type:

1. `React.ComponentProps`
2. `React.ComponentPropsWithRef`
3. `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`

If you attempted to use the first, `ComponentProps`, you‚Äôd see a relevant note that reads:

> *Prefer `ComponentPropsWithRef`, if the `ref` is forwarded, or `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` when refs are not supported.*

![Note To Prefer ComponentPropsWithRef Or ComponentPropsWithoutRef](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/prefer-componentpropswithref-or-without.png)

This is precisely what we‚Äôve done. For now, we will ignore the use case for supporting a `ref` prop and stick to `ComponentPropsWithoutRef`.

Now, let‚Äôs give the solution a try!

If you go ahead and use this component wrongly, e.g., passing a valid `as` prop with other incompatible props, you‚Äôll get an error.

```tsx
<Text as="div" href="www.google.com">Hello Text world</Text>
```

A value of `div` is perfectly valid for the `as` prop, but a `div` should not have an `href` attribute.

That‚Äôs wrong, and rightly caught by TypeScript with the error: `Property 'href' does not exist on type ...`.

![Property Href Does Not Exist Error](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/property-href-doesnt-exist-error.png)

This is great! We‚Äôve got an even better, more robust solution.

Finally, make sure to [**pass other props down**](/blog.logrocket.com/solving-prop-drilling-react-apps.md) to the rendered element:

```tsx
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>; 

export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType>({
  as,
  children,
  ...restProps, // üëà look here
}: TextProps<C>) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  // see restProps passed üëá
  return <Component {...restProps}>{children}</Component>;
};
```

Let‚Äôs keep going.
