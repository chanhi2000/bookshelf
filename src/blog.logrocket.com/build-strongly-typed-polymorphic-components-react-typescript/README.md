As you can see, this is quite long, so feel free to skip around. If you’d like to follow along, star the [official code repository (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`ohansemmanuel/polymorphic-react-component`)](https://github.com/ohansemmanuel/polymorphic-react-component) on my GitHub for reference.

## Conclusion and ideas for next steps

You have successfully built a robust solution for handling polymorphic components in React with TypeScript. I know it wasn’t an easy ride, but you did it.

Thanks for following along. Remember to star the official [GitHub repository (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`ohansemmanuel/polymorphic-react-component`)](https://github.com/ohansemmanuel/polymorphic-react-component), where you’ll find all the code for this guide.
