Do you remember every reference to `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef` so far? ðŸ˜… Component props â€¦ *without* refs. Well, nowâ€™s the time to put the refs in!

This is the final and most complex part of our solution. Iâ€™ll need you to be patient here, but Iâ€™ll also do my best to explain every step in detail.

First things first, do you remember [**how `refs` in React work**](/blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-react-refs.md)? The most important concept here is that you just donâ€™t pass `ref` as a prop and expect it to be passed down into your component like every other prop. The recommended way to handle `refs` in your functional components is to use the [**`forwardRef` function**](/blog.logrocket.com/cleaning-up-the-dom-with-forwardref-in-react/).

Letâ€™s start off on a practical note.

If you go ahead and pass a `ref` to our `Text` component now, youâ€™ll get an error that reads `Property 'ref' does not exist on type ...`.

```tsx
// Create the ref object 
const divRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);
... 
// Pass the ref to the rendered Text component
<Text as="div" ref={divRef}>
  Hello Text world
</Text>
```

![Property Ref Does Not Exist Error](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/property-ref-doesnt-exist-error.jpeg)

This is expected.

Our first shot at supporting refs will be to use `forwardRef` in the `Text` component as shown below:

```tsx
// before 
export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType = "span">({
  as,
  color,
  children,
}: PolymorphicComponentProp<C, TextProps>) => {
  ...
};


// after
import React from "react";

export const Text = React.forwardRef(
  <C extends React.ElementType = "span">({
    as,
    color,
    children,
  }: PolymorphicComponentProp<C, TextProps>) => {
    ...
  }
);
```

This is essentially just wrapping the previous code in `React.forwardRef`, thatâ€™s all.

Now, `React.forwardRef` has the following signature:

```tsx
React.forwardRef((props, ref) ... )
```

Essentially, the second argument received is the `ref` object. Letâ€™s go ahead and handle that:

```tsx
type PolymorphicRef<C extends React.ElementType> = unknown;

export const Text = React.forwardRef(
  <C extends React.ElementType = "span">(
    { as, color, children }: PolymorphicComponentProp<C, TextProps>,
    // ðŸ‘‡ look here
    ref?: PolymorphicRef<C>
  ) => {
    ...
  }
);
```

What weâ€™ve done here is added the second argument, `ref`, and declared its type as `PolymorphicRef`, which just points to `unknown` for now.

Note that `PolymorphicRef` takes in the generic `C`. This is similar to previous solutions â€” the `ref` object for a `div` differs from that of a `span`, so we need to take into consideration the element type passed to the `as` prop.

Point your attention to the `PolymorphicRef` type. How can we get the `ref` object type based on the `as` prop?

Let me give you a clue: `React.ComponentPropsWithRef`!

Note that this says *with* ref. Not *without* ref.

Essentially, if this were a bundle of keys (which, in fact, it is), itâ€™ll include all the relevant component props based on the element type, plus the ref object.

![The ComponentPropsWithRef Type](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/componentpropswithref-type.png)

So now, if we know this object type contains the `ref` key, we may as well get that ref type by doing the following:

```tsx
// before 
type PolymorphicRef<C extends React.ElementType> = unknown;

// after 
type PolymorphicRef<C extends React.ElementType> =
  React.ComponentPropsWithRef<C>["ref"];
```

Essentially, `React.ComponentPropsWithRef<C>` returns an object type, e.g.,

```tsx
{
  ref: SomeRefDefinition, 
  // ... other keys, 
  color: string 
  href: string 
  // ... etc
}
```

To pick out just the `ref` type, we can then do this:

```tsx
React.ComponentPropsWithRef<C>["ref"];
```

Note that the syntax is similar to the property accessor syntax in JavaScript, i.e., `["ref"]`. Now that weâ€™ve got the `ref` prop typed, we can go ahead and pass that down to the rendered element:

```tsx
export const Text = React.forwardRef(
  <C extends React.ElementType = "span">(
    { as, color, children }: PolymorphicComponentProp<C, TextProps>,
    ref?: PolymorphicRef<C>
  ) => {
    //...

    return (
      <Component {...style} ref={ref}> // ðŸ‘ˆ look here
        {children}
      </Component>
    );
  }
);
```

Weâ€™ve made decent progress! In fact, if you go ahead and check the usage of `Text` like we did before, thereâ€™ll be no more errors:

```tsx
// create the ref object 
const divRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);
... 
// pass ref to the rendered Text component
<Text as="div" ref={divRef}>
  Hello Text world
</Text>
```

However, our solution still isnâ€™t as strongly typed as Iâ€™d like. Letâ€™s go ahead and change the ref passed to the `Text` as shown below:

```tsx
// create a "button" ref object 
const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement | null>(null);
... 
// pass a button ref to a "div". NB: as = "div"
<Text as="div" ref={buttonRef}>
  Hello Text world
</Text>
```

TypeScript should throw an error here, but it doesnâ€™t. Weâ€™re creating a `button` ref, but passing it to a `div` element. Thatâ€™s not right.

![No Error Thrown When A Wrong Element Ref Is Passed](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/no-error-thrown.png)

If you take a look at the exact type of `ref`, it looks like this:

```tsx
React.RefAttributes<unknown>.ref?: React.Ref<unknown>
```

Do you see the `unknown` in there? Thatâ€™s a sign of weak typing. We should ideally have `HTMLDivElement` in there to explicitly define the ref object as a `div` element ref.

Weâ€™ve got work to do. Letâ€™s first look at the types for the other props of the `Text` component, which still reference the `PolymorphicComponentProp` type. Change this to a new type called `PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef`. This will just be a union of `PolymorphicComponentProp` and the ref prop. (You guessed right.)

Here it is:

```tsx
type PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef<
  C extends React.ElementType,
  Props = {}
> = PolymorphicComponentProp<C, Props> & 
{ ref?: PolymorphicRef<C> };
```

This is just a union of the previous `PolymorphicComponentProp` and `{ ref?: PolymorphicRef<C> }`.

Now we need to change the props of the component to reference the new `PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef` type:

```tsx
// before
type TextProps = { color?: Rainbow | "black" };

export const Text = React.forwardRef(
  <C extends React.ElementType = "span">(
    { as, color, children }: PolymorphicComponentProp<C, TextProps>,
    ref?: PolymorphicRef<C>
  ) => {
    ...
  }
);


// now 
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = 
PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef<
  C,
  { color?: Rainbow | "black" }
>;

export const Text = React.forwardRef(
  <C extends React.ElementType = "span">(
    { as, color, children }: TextProps<C>, // ðŸ‘ˆ look here
    ref?: PolymorphicRef<C>
  ) => {
    ...
  }
);
```

Weâ€™ve updated `TextProps` to reference `PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef` and thatâ€™s now passed as the props for the `Text` component. Lovely!

Thereâ€™s one final thing to do: provide a type annotation for the `Text` component. It looks similar to:

```tsx
export const Text : TextComponent = ...
```

`TextComponent` is the type annotation weâ€™ll write. Here it is fully written out:

```tsx
type TextComponent = <C extends React.ElementType = "span">(
  props: TextProps<C>
) => React.ReactElement | null;
```

This is essentially a functional component that takes in `TextProps` and returns `React.ReactElement | null`, where `TextProps` is as defined earlier:

```tsx
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = 
PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef<
  C,
  { color?: Rainbow | "black" }
>;
```

With this, we now have a complete solution!

Iâ€™m going to share the complete solution now. It may seem daunting at first, but remember weâ€™ve worked line by line through everything you see here. Read it with that confidence.

```tsx :collapsed-lines
import React from "react";

type Rainbow =
  | "red"
  | "orange"
  | "yellow"
  | "green"
  | "blue"
  | "indigo"
  | "violet";

type AsProp<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
};

type PropsToOmit<C extends React.ElementType, P> = keyof (AsProp<C> & P);

// This is the first reusable type utility we built
type PolymorphicComponentProp<
  C extends React.ElementType,
  Props = {}
> = React.PropsWithChildren<Props & AsProp<C>> &
  Omit<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>, PropsToOmit<C, Props>>;

// This is a new type utitlity with ref!
type PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef<
  C extends React.ElementType,
  Props = {}
> = PolymorphicComponentProp<C, Props> & { ref?: PolymorphicRef<C> };

// This is the type for the "ref" only
type PolymorphicRef<C extends React.ElementType> =
  React.ComponentPropsWithRef<C>["ref"];

/**
* This is the updated component props using PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef
*/
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = 
PolymorphicComponentPropWithRef<
  C,
  { color?: Rainbow | "black" }
>;

/**
* This is the type used in the type annotation for the component
*/
type TextComponent = <C extends React.ElementType = "span">(
  props: TextProps<C>
) => React.ReactElement | null;

export const Text: TextComponent = React.forwardRef(
  <C extends React.ElementType = "span">(
    { as, color, children }: TextProps<C>,
    ref?: PolymorphicRef<C>
  ) => {
    const Component = as || "span";

    const style = color ? { style: { color } } : {};

    return (
      <Component {...style} ref={ref}>
        {children}
      </Component>
    );
  }
);
```

And there you go!
