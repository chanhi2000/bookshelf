Our current solution is much better than what we started with. Give yourself a pat on the back for making it this far â€” it only gets more interesting from here.

The use case to cater to in this section is very applicable in the real world. Thereâ€™s a high chance that if youâ€™re building some sort of component, then that component will also take in some specific props that are unique to the component.

Our current solution takes into consideration the `as`, `children`, and the other component props based on the `as` prop. However, what if we wanted this component to handle its own props?

Letâ€™s make this practical. We will have the `Text` component receive a `color` prop. The `color` here will either be any of the rainbow colors or `black`.

We will go ahead and represent this as follows:

```tsx
type Rainbow =
  | "red"
  | "orange"
  | "yellow"
  | "green"
  | "blue"
  | "indigo"
  | "violet";
```

Next, we must define the `color` prop in the `TextProps` object as follows:

```tsx
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
  color?: Rainbow | "black"; // ðŸ‘ˆ look here
  children: React.ReactNode;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>;
```

Before we go ahead, letâ€™s have a bit of a refactor. Letâ€™s represent the actual props of the `Text` component by a `Props` object, and specifically type only the props specific to our component in the `TextProps` object.

This will become obvious, as youâ€™ll see below:

```tsx
// new "Props" type
type Props <C extends React.ElementType> = TextProps<C>

export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType = "span">({
  as,
  children,
  ...restProps,
}: Props<C>) => {
  const Component = as || "span";
  return <Component {...restProps}>{children}</Component>;
};
```

Now letâ€™s clean up `TextProps`:

```tsx
// before 
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
  color?: Rainbow | "black"; // ðŸ‘ˆ look here
  children: React.ReactNode;
} & React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>;

// after
type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
  color?: Rainbow | "black";
};
```

Now, `TextProps` should just contain the props that are specific to our `Text` component: `as` and `color`.

We must now update the definition for `Props` to include the types weâ€™ve removed from `TextProps`, i.e., `children` and `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>`.

For the `children` prop, weâ€™ll take advantage of the `React.PropsWithChildren` prop.

![The PropsWithChildren Type](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/propswithchildren-type.png)

`PropsWithChildren` is pretty easy to reason out. You pass it your component props, and itâ€™ll inject the children props definition for you:

```tsx
type Props <C extends React.ElementType> = 
React.PropsWithChildren<TextProps<C>>
```

Note how we use the angle braces; this is the syntax for passing on generics. Essentially, the `React.PropsWithChildren` accepts your component props as a generic and augments it with the `children` prop. Sweet!

For `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>`, weâ€™ll just go ahead and leverage an intersection type here:

```tsx
type Props <C extends React.ElementType> = 
React.PropsWithChildren<TextProps<C>> & 
React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>
```

And hereâ€™s the full current solution:

```tsx
type Rainbow =
  | "red"
  | "orange"
  | "yellow"
  | "green"
  | "blue"
  | "indigo"
  | "violet";

type TextProps<C extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: C;
  color?: Rainbow | "black";
};

type Props <C extends React.ElementType> = 
React.PropsWithChildren<TextProps<C>> & 
React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<C>

export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType = "span">({
  as,
  children,
}: Props<C>) => {
  const Component = as || "span";
  return <Component> {children} </Component>;
};
```

I know these can feel like a lot, but when you take a closer look itâ€™ll all make sense. Itâ€™s really just putting together everything youâ€™ve learned so far!

Having done this necessary refactor, we can now continue on to our solution. What we have now actually works. Weâ€™ve explicitly typed the `color` prop, and you may use it as follows:

```tsx
<Text color="violet">Hello world</Text>
```
