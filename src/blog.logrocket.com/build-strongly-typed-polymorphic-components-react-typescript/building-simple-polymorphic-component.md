Contrary to what you may think, building your first polymorphic component is quite straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic implementation:

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ as, children }) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

Note here that the polymorphic prop `as` is similar to Chakra UIâ€™s. This is the prop we expose to control the render element of the polymorphic component.

Secondly, note that the `as` prop isnâ€™t rendered directly. The following would be wrong:

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ as, children }) => {
  // wrong render below ðŸ‘‡ 
  return <as>{children}</as>;
};
```

When [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>rendering an element type at runtime](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#choosing-the-type-at-runtime), you must first assign it to a capitalized variable, and then render the capitalized variable.

Now you can go ahead and use this component as follows:

```jsx
<MyComponent as="button">Hello Polymorphic!<MyComponent>
<MyComponent as="div">Hello Polymorphic!</MyComponent>
<MyComponent as="span">Hello Polymorphic!</MyComponent>
<MyComponent as="em">Hello Polymorphic!</MyComponent>
```

Note that the different `as` prop is passed to the rendered components above.
