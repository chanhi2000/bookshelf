If you‚Äôre reading this, a prerequisite is that you already know some TypeScript ‚Äî at least the basics. If you have no clue what TypeScript is, I strongly recommend [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-typescript"/>giving this document a read](https://typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html) first.

In this section, we will use TypeScript to solve the aforementioned concerns and build strongly typed polymorphic components.

The first two requirements we will start off with include:

- The `as` prop should not receive invalid HTML element strings
- Wrong attributes should not be passed for valid elements

In the following section, we will introduce TypeScript generics to make our solution more robust, developer-friendly, and production-worthy.

---

## Ensuring the `as` prop only receives valid HTML element strings

Here‚Äôs our current solution:

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ as, children }) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

To make the next sections of this guide practical, we‚Äôll change the name of the component from `MyComponent` to `Text` and assume we‚Äôre building a polymorphic `Text` component.

```jsx
const Text = ({ as, children }) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

Now, with your knowledge of generics, it becomes obvious that we‚Äôre better off representing `as` with a generic type, i.e., a variable type based on whatever the user passes in.

![The As Prop](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/as-prop.png)

Let‚Äôs go ahead and take the first step as follows:

```tsx
export const Text = <C>({
  as,
  children,
}: {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

Note how the generic `C` is defined and then passed on in the type definition for the prop `as`.

However, if you wrote this seemingly perfect code, you‚Äôll have TypeScript yelling out numerous errors with more squiggly red lines than you‚Äôd like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

![The JSX Generic Error](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/jsx-generic-error.png)

What‚Äôs going on here is a flaw in the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-stack-overflow"/>syntax for generics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32308370/what-is-the-syntax-for-typescript-arrow-functions-with-generics?) in `.tsx` files. There are two ways to solve this.

---

## 1. Add a comma after the generic declaration

This is the syntax for declaring multiple generics. Once you do this, the TypeScript compiler clearly understands your intent and the errors are banished.

```tsx
// note the comma after "C" below üëá
export const Text = <C,>({
  as,
  children,
}: {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

---

## 2. Constrain the generic

The second option is to constrain the generic as you see fit. For starters, you can just use the `unknown` type as follows:

```tsx
// note the extends keyword below üëá
export const Text = <C extends unknown>({
  as,
  children,
}: {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

For now, I‚Äôll stick to the second solution because it‚Äôs closer to our final solution. In most cases, though, I use the multiple generic syntax and just add a comma.

However, with our current solution, we get another TypeScript error:

> JSX element type ‚ÄòComponent‚Äô does not have any construct or call signatures. ts(2604)

![No Construct Or Call Error](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/no-construct-or-call-error.png)

This is similar to the error we had when we worked with the `echoLength` function. Just like accessing the `length` property of an unknown variable type, the same may be said here: trying to render any generic type as a valid React component doesn‚Äôt make sense.

We need to constrain the generic only to fit the mold of a valid React element type.

To achieve this, we‚Äôll leverage the internal React type: `React.ElementType`, and make sure the generic is constrained to fit that type:

```tsx
// look just after the extends keyword üëá
export const Text = <C extends React.ElementType>({
  as,
  children,
}: {
  as?: C;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) => {
  const Component = as || "span";

  return <Component>{children}</Component>;
};
```

Note that if you‚Äôre using an older version of React, you may have to import a newer React version as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
```

With this, we have no more errors!

Now, if you go ahead and use this component as follows, it‚Äôll work just fine:

```jsx
<Text as="div">Hello Text world</Text>
```

However, if you pass an invalid `as` prop, you‚Äôll now get an appropriate TypeScript error. Consider the example below:

```jsx
<Text as="emmanuel">Hello Text world</Text>
```

And the error thrown:

> Type ‚Äò‚Äùemmanuel‚Äù‚Äò is not assignable to type ‚ÄòElementType | undefined‚Äô.

![Type Emmanuel Is Not Assignable Error](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-strongly-typed-polymorphic-components-react-typescript/type-emmanuel-not-assginable-error.jpeg)

This is excellent! We now have a solution that doesn‚Äôt accept gibberish for the `as` prop and will also prevent against nasty typos, e.g., `divv` instead of `div`.

This is a much better developer experience!
