Forms are a staple of web development. If you must collect user input on the web and process these on your server, you need a form.

![Build powerful React forms with Informed](/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/build-powerful-react-forms-with-informed/banner.png)

While there are many libraries for working with forms in React, in this article, Iâ€™ll show you how to build powerful forms using the [Informed library (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`teslamotors/informed`)](https://github.com/teslamotors/informed). Informed is a lightweight framework and utility for building powerful forms in React applications.

What sets the Informed library apart from its competitors is it has all the tools youâ€™d expect of a framework: opinionated form UI components and state management, combined with baked-in utilities for formatting, masking, debugging and much more.

Letâ€™s get started.

---

## Setting up Informed

To get started, install the <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-npm"/>`informed` library in your <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-npm"/>`react` project via npm:

```sh
npm install informed
```

A form, at its core, is mostly made of a parent form component and several children input fields. The input fields can take several forms, e.g., a basic text field, text area, radio input, checkbox input, select input, number input, etc. This is true regardless of the `react` form library.

Consider the following basic form:

![An [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>example of a basic form](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-jqjc8h?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/basic-form-example.png)

At its core, this is a form with three input elements: two text fields and a **Submit** button.

To represent this form via `informed`, we can use its inbuilt components, as shown below:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import * as React from 'react';
import { Form, Input, Debug } from 'informed'; {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Form
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
      <h1>Sign in </h1>
      <Input name="email" label="Email:" placeholder="email@example.com" />
      <Input name="password" type="password" label="Password:" placeholder="**********" />
      <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Note how the props passed to the `Input` field are similar to standard HTML input attributes, i.e., `name` and `placeholder`.

This `Form` is relatively simple. When submitted, the form values are logged in the console. An empty object will be logged if you attempt to submit without any input entries:

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Logging form state](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-jqjc8h?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/logging-form-state.png)

```tsx
{/** ... **/}
onSubmit={(formState) => {
  console.log(formState.values);
}}
{/** ... **/}
```

---

## Simple form validation (with messages)

The reason there are so many form libraries isnâ€™t that itâ€™s difficult to write HTML input fields â€” the hardship lies in managing form state and input validation. In the basic example above, a user could submit empty inputs. This is far from production ready.

Letâ€™s fix this.

### Simple required inputs

The first layer of validation is to simply make the fields required. Do this by passing the `required` prop to the `informed` inputs:

```tsx
{/** ... **/}
<Input
  required {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
  name="email"
  label="Email:"
  placeholder="email@example.com"
/>
<Input
  required {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
  name="password"
  label="Password:"
  placeholder="**********"
/>
{/** ... **/}
```

Now, when you attempt to submit the form, youâ€™ll see the default `This field is required` error message displayed below the required input fields.

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Default required messages](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-pzay2d?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/default-required-messages.png)

### Changing the required input validation message

In production applications, youâ€™ll want full control over the message shown to your users. The default message, `This field is required`, may not suffice. You may also want to pass a localized message based on the language of the user.

To accomplish this, pass an `errorMessage` prop to the required inputs, as shown below:

```tsx
{/** ... **/}
<Input
  required
  name="email"
  label="Email:"
  placeholder="email@example.com"
  errorMessage="Your email is required" {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
/>
<Input
  required
  name="password"
  type="password"
  label="Password:"
  placeholder="**********"
  errorMessage="Your password is required" {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
/>
{/** ... **/}
```

The above code produces the following:

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Custom error messages](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-pzsrhk?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/custom-error-messages.png)

---

## Going beyond basic, required validation

Adding the `required` prop is a great first step. However, in real-world projects, youâ€™ll want to go further than that.

Our sign-in form could use a bit more validation. For example, how about validating the actual email input for erroneously-entered emails? And what about validating the length of the password input?

For greater validation flexibility, you can pass a `validate` function prop to the relevant inputs, as shown below:

```tsx :collapsed-lines title="App.tsx"
import * as React from 'react';
import { Form, Input, Debug } from 'informed';

const validateEmail = (v: string) => {
  if (!v.includes('@')) {
    return 'Please pass a valid email';
  }
};

const validatePassword = (v: string) => {
  if (v.length < 6) {
    return 'Your password must be at least 7 characters long';
  }
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Form
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
      <h1>Sign in </h1>
      <Input
        required
        name="email"
        label="Email:"
        validate={validateEmail} {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
        placeholder="email@example.com"
        errorMessage="Your email is required"
      />
      <Input
        required
        name="password"
                type="password"
        label="Password:"
        placeholder="**********"
        validate={validatePassword} {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
        errorMessage="Your password is required"
      />
      <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Now, the default `errorMessage` prop will always be shown when the basic `required` validation kicks in. However, once the inputs are filled and submitted, the `validate` function kicks in and the returned string is shown as the input error message:

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Custom validator functions](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-bjokq2?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/custom-validator-functions.png)

## Schema validation with Yup

In practice, most people use robust schema validation libraries like [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`jquense/yup`](https://github.com/jquense/yup). Informed lets you [**use Yup**](/blog.logrocket.com/comparing-schema-validation-libraries-zod-vs-yup.md) as well.

Letâ€™s [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>rewrite our existing validation](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-9lrju6?file=App.tsx) to use Yup, as shown below:

```tsx :collapsed-lines title="App.tsx"
import * as Yup from 'yup';
import * as React from 'react';
import { Form, Input } from 'informed';

{/** ðŸ‘‡ look here **/}
const validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({
  email: Yup.string()
    .email('Please pass a valid email')
    .required('Your email is required'),
  password: Yup.string()
    .required('Your password is required')
    .min(7, 'Your password must be at least 7 characters long'),
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Form
      yupSchema={validationSchema} {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
      <h1>Sign in </h1>
      <Input name="email" label="Email:" placeholder="email@example.com" />
      <Input
        type="password"
        name="password"
        label="Password:"
        placeholder="**********"
      />
      <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Whatâ€™s important about the above is that we pass the `yupSchema` prop to the `Form` component, and then define your validation schema as you normally would.

---

## Exploring other input types

How does Informed deal with other form input types such as text areas, radio inputs, and select inputs? The usage is quite similar to regular inputs: you import the associated informed component and pass it the relevant props.

Consider the example below:

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Other form inputs](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-hrzu3i?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/other-form-inputs.png)

The form above leverages a text area, radio group, checkbox, and select inputs. With Informed, using these is as simple as importing the components (capitalize the names) and passing the same props you would the HTML element, with the addition of a `label` prop for accessibility.

Hereâ€™s how:

```tsx :collapsed-lines title="App.tsx"
import * as React from 'react';
import {
  Form,
  Input,
  TextArea,
  Checkbox,
  Select,
  Option,
  Radio,
  RadioGroup,
} from 'informed';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Form
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
      <h1>Sign up </h1>
      <Input
        required
        name="name"
        label="Name:"
        placeholder="email@example.com"
      />
      <TextArea {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
        required
        name="bio"
        label="Bio:"
        placeholder="I am a teacher and a developer ..."
      />

      <RadioGroup name="relationship"> {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
        <Radio value="single" label="Single" />
        <Radio value="married" label="married" />
      </RadioGroup>

      {/** ðŸ‘‡ look here **/}
      <Checkbox name="newsletter" label="Subscribe to our newsletter?" />

      {/** ðŸ‘‡ look here **/}
      <Select name="status" label="Relationship status:">
        <Option value="" disabled>
          Select One...
        </Option>
        <Option value="single">Single</Option>
        <Option value="relationship">Relationship</Option>
        <Option value="complicated">Complicated</Option>
      </Select>

      <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

---

## The `Debug` component

Debugging is a vital part of building real-world software. With `Informed`, instead of manually rendering the form values or battling console logs, you can use the `Debug` component to view the current form state.

Consider the use of `Debug` in the last example:

```tsx
import {Debug} from 'informed'

... 
<Debug /> 
...
```

All you have to do is render the `Debug` component, and you get a visual representation of the current synced state of the entire form.

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>The `debug` component](https://react-ts-r5ye9f.stackblitz.io)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/debug-component.png)

To view the state of a single form field, use `DebugField` with the `name` of the field in question, as shown below:

```tsx
import {DebugField} from 'informed'

... 
<DebugField name="gender"/> 
...
```

---

## Controlling when validation occurs

Having control over when you trigger form validation is powerful. For example, you may want to show errors as soon as the form is mounted in order to validate the initial values received from a server, or the defaults passed when initializing an SDK.

To validate as soon as the form mounts, pass the `validateOnMount` prop to the `Form` component:

```tsx
<Form validateOnMount />
```

If you went ahead to do this, validation will occur on mount, but the errors will not show to the user.

You can control when to show the validation error to the user with the `showErrorIfError`, `showErrorIfTouched` or `showErrorIfDirty` prop. (`showErrorIfTouched` is the default value here.)

To validate the form and show errors immediately on mount, do this:

```tsx
<Form validateOnMount showErrorIfError/>
```

And now, errors will be [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>displayed as soon as the form is mounted](https://react-ts-mtfabt.stackblitz.io) (after validation):

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Showing errors on mount](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-mtfabt?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/showing-errors-on-mount.png)

By default, validation will occur when a field is blurred, but you can change this behavior. To further control when your field validation occurs, use the `validateOn` prop with any of these values:

- `change`
- `blur`
- `change-blur`
- `change-submit`
- `blur-submit`
- `submit`

You can also use the `change` value for some real-time field validation, like so:

```tsx :collapsed-lines title="App.tsx"
{/** ... **/}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Form
      showErrorIfError
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */ }

      <TextArea
        name="bio"
        label="Bio:"
        validateOn="change" {/** ðŸ‘ˆ look here **/}
        placeholder="I am a teacher and a developer ..."
      />

      {/* ... */ }
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Note that `showErrorIfError` is used to display the error immediately after validation â€” not after the input field is blurred. The `validateOn` prop is also passed to the `TextArea` component and a `validate` function is provided.

This will simulate [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>real-time validation,](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-79eqiu?file=App.tsx) with the error shown to the user as it is encountered.

## Conditionally render form fields by accessing the form state

At first glance, conditionally rendering a form field isnâ€™t a difficult task. You just have to follow the same principles of `JSX` youâ€™re already familiar with, e.g.:

```tsx
true && <ConditionallyRenderThis />
```

However, when the conditional render depends on the internal state of your form, you need access to the form state.

There are several ways to do this with `Informed`. Perhaps the most flexible option is to grab the state of the entire form using the `useFormState` Hook, and then conditionally render as you normally would:

```tsx :collapsed-lines title="App.tsx"
const SpouseName = () => {
  const formState = useFormState();
  return (
    formState.values?.relationship === 'married' && (
      <Input name="spouse" label="ðŸš¨ Spouse Name:" />
    )
  );
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Form
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
     {/* ... */ }
      <SpouseName />
      {/* ... */ }
    </Form>
  );
}
```

And now, when a user selects the **Married** option, we will go ahead and request their spouseâ€™s name.

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Conditionally display an input field](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-dd2iap?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conditionally-display-input-field.png)

Itâ€™s important to note that the `useFormState` Hook is used in a separate child component rendered within the `Form`. If you went ahead to use the `useFormState` Hook in the parent component rendering the `Form`, this will not work.

`formState.values` will always be `undefined` here. You must use the Hook within the `Form` component to internally gain access to the form context:

```tsx :collapsed-lines title="App.tsx"
export default function App() {
  const formState = useFormState()

  return (
    <Form
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
     {/* ... */ }
      {formState.values?.relationship === 'married' && (
         <Input name="spouse" label="ðŸš¨ Spouse Name:" />
      )
      {/* ... */ }
    </Form>
  );
}
```

---

## Easy, conditionally-rendered form fields

Informed also exports a `Relevant` component to simplify conditional renders. For example, we could rework our previous example to use the `Relevant` component, as shown below:

```tsx
<Form
    onSubmit={(formState) => {
      console.log(formState.values);
    }}
   >
   {/** ... */}

   <Relevant
        when={({ formState }) => formState.values?.gender === 'non_binary'}
      >
      <Input name="spouse" label="ðŸš¨ Spouse Name:" />
   </Relevant>

   {/** ... */}

   <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
 </Form>
```

The condition for rendering the child component is passed to the `when` function prop, which receives the form state as an argument and returns a `boolean`.

If this evaluates to `true`, the children components are rendered. In this case: `<Input name="spouse" label="ðŸš¨ Spouse Name:" />`.

Alternatively, you can also apply conditional rendering at the field level by passing a `relevant` prop to the required field. Consider the example below:

```tsx
{/** ... **/}
 <Select
    name="date"
    label="ðŸš¨ Shall we help you set up a date?"
    relevant={({ formState }) =>
      formState.values?.relationship === 'single'
    }
  >
    <Option value="" disabled>
      Select a date option
    </Option>
    <Option value="yes">Yes</Option>
    <Option value="no">No</Option>
 </Select>
{/** ... **/}
```

Now, whenever the user selects their relationship status as `single`, weâ€™ll go ahead and render a `select` input asking whether to set them up on a date or not.

![[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-stackblitz"/>Conditionally rendering a field with the `relevant` prop](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-p31ahp?file=App.tsx)](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/conditionally-rendering-field-with-relevant-prop.png)

Instead of using the `Relevant` component, weâ€™re leveraging the `relevant` prop here. Itâ€™s got a similar API to the `when` prop passed to `Relevant`. The value of the prop is a function that receives the form state, and the expected return value is a `boolean`.

---

## Easier data organization with scopes

So far, weâ€™ve only worked with a flat-form state structure. For example, our form, when filled out, will have a state similar to:

```json
{
  "name": "Amadeus Mozart",
  "bio": "Senior software engineer",
  "relationship": "single",
  "date": "no",
  "newsletter": true,
  "status": "single"
}
```

However, with complex forms, you might want to nest related values within the form state.  
For example, we could instead have the following state representation:

```json
{
  "name": "Amadeus Mozart",
  "bio": "Senior software engineer",
  "bond": {
    "relationship": "single",
    "status": "single",
    "date": "no"
  },
  "marketing": {
    "newsletter": true
  }
}
```

Note the nested `bond` and `marketing` fields. To achieve this, `Informed` exposes a `Scope` component for grouping related form fields. All we need to do is wrap the child fields in a `Scope` component, with a `scope` prop pointing to the name of the eventual nested parent.

Hereâ€™s an example:

```tsx :collapsed-lines title="App.tsx"
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Form
      onSubmit={(formState) => {
        console.log(formState.values);
      }}
    >
      {/** ... **/}

     {/** Look here ðŸ‘‡ **/}
      <Scope scope="bond">
        <RadioGroup name="relationship">
          <Radio value="single" label="Single" />
          <Radio value="married" label="married" />
        </RadioGroup>

        <Relevant
          when={({ formState }) =>
            formState.values?.bond?.relationship === 'married'
          }
        >
          <Input name="spouse" label="ðŸš¨ Spouse Name:" />
        </Relevant>

        <Select
          name="date"
          label="ðŸš¨ Shall we help you set up a date?"
          relevant={({ formState }) =>
            formState.values?.bond?.relationship === 'single'
          }
        >
          <Option value="" disabled>
            Select a date option
          </Option>
          <Option value="yes">Yes</Option>
          <Option value="no">No</Option>
        </Select>

        <Select name="status" label="Relationship status:">
          <Option value="" disabled>
            Select One...
          </Option>
          <Option value="single">Single</Option>
          <Option value="relationship">Relationship</Option>
          <Option value="complicated">Complicated</Option>
        </Select>
      </Scope>

      {/** Look here ðŸ‘‡ **/}
      <Scope scope="marketing">
        <Checkbox name="newsletter" label="Subscribe to our newsletter?" />
      </Scope>

      <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Itâ€™s important to note that when you use the `Scope` component, you must remember to use the new nested hierarchy wherever you access the form state.

For example, consider the `relevant` prop logic:

```tsx
// before // [!code --]
formState.values?.relationship === 'single' // [!code --]
// now: use the nested "bond" scope // [!code ++]
formState.values?.bond?.relationship === 'single' // [!code ++]
```

---

## Adding input formatters and masks to Informed

If youâ€™ve tried shipping production input formatters or masks without the help of a library, then you know they can get unwieldy quickly. With `Informed`, you can handle this using either character strings or good old regex.

Consider the following new requirement for our form application: if the user is single and wishes to be set up for a date, go ahead and request their phone number to make it happen.

Assuming the application is only available in the US, letâ€™s go ahead and provide some input formatting for the userâ€™s phone number:

```tsx
/* ... */

<Input
  type="tel"
  name="tel"
  label="Phone number"
  relevant={({ formState }) =>
    formState.values?.bond?.relationship === 'single' &&
    formState.values?.bond?.date === 'yes'
  }
/>;
```

Using the `relevant` prop, the phone number input will be displayed when the userâ€™s relationship status is set to `single`, and theyâ€™d like a date.

Now, we may go ahead and provide a `formatter` prop to this phone number input, as shown below:

```tsx
<Input
  {/** ... **/}
  formatter="+1 ###-###-####"
  {/** ... **/}
/>;
```

This will format the user input to `+1 ###-###-####`, where `#` represents valid digits. If you inspect the form state, youâ€™ll see the phone number is stored in the same format.

If youâ€™d rather store the raw user input in the form state, go ahead and provide a `parser` function prop to strip away the formatting, as shown below:

```tsx
<Input
  {/** ... **/}
  formatter="+1 ###-###-####"
  parser={(v) => v.replace('+1 ', '').replace(/-/g, '')}
  {/** ... **/}
/>;
```

The provided `parser` function takes a value and replaces the telephone code (`+1`) and the dashes (`-`).

There are obviously a lot of other use cases for input formatting and masking. I recommend giving the [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>official docs](https://teslamotors.github.io/informed/?path=/story/formatting--formatter) a read.

## Why use Informed?

Now that youâ€™ve got an overview of how Informed works, letâ€™s discuss why you should consider using `Informed` for your next project.

### Informed vs. Formik

[<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`jaredpalmer/formik`](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) is arguably the most popular open source form library for React and React Native. So, how does Informed stack up against the juggernaut?

Most of the beloved features of Formik work identically in Informed. They both have declarative APIs, so you can focus on your application business logic. They also both follow the same React mental model youâ€™re used to â€” i.e., no fancy observers or subscriptions under the hood, just good olâ€™ React state and props. They also donâ€™t tie you to any particular state management library out-of-the-box. As such, they are both adaptable to use with any state management library, like Redux.

Where Informed begins to shine is the additional utilities it provides over Formik. Informed provides:

- Explicit provisions for formatting and masking input fields
- The special [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>`Debug` component](https://teslamotors.github.io/informed/?path=/story/debugging--debug)
- More options for dynamic forms using the [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>`Relevant` component](https://teslamotors.github.io/informed/?path=/story/relevance--relevant-comonent) and additional utilities, such as [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>KeepState](https://teslamotors.github.io/informed/?path=/story/keepstate--keepstate), which lets you keep the state of a field even when it gets unmounted (no longer rendered on screen)

Informed goes beyond the basic needs and provides utilities to solve commonly used problems youâ€™re likely to encounter in the real world.

In my opinion, `Informed` stacks up well against Formik.

### Informed vs. React Hook Form

[<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-react"/>React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is an excellent alternative to building forms in React. Itâ€™s arguably the second most popular React form library. As with Formik, the provision of form utilities is what sets Informed apart here.

However, it is worth mentioning that React Hook Formâ€™s standout feature is that it does not rely on controlled form inputs, which arguably gives it performance gains over a lot of other form libraries (Informed inclusive).

## Conclusion

Informed, while still a young library, is full of potential. If you find yourself starting a new project or wanting to tinker with a new form library, give Informed a shot.

A caveat Iâ€™ve encountered working with Informed is there are obvious updates to be made to the documentation and exported types, but thatâ€™s the beauty of a new project with potential. You can contribute to its development.

Cheers, and happy form building!
