In this tutorial, you’ll gain a better understanding of what Gradle is, and how you can use Gradle to supercharge your builds. By the end of this tutorial you should be able to

1. Build your Android apps from the command-line
2. Read through a Gradle build file
3. Create your own Gradle plugin
4. Create build flavors for profit!

::: tip Note

This tutorial assumes you’re already familiar with the basics of Android development. If you are completely new to Android development, read through our [Beginning Android Development](https://www.raywenderlich.com/177533/beginning-android-development-kotlin-part-one-installing-android-studio) tutorials to familiarize yourself with the basics.

## What is Gradle?

Gradle is an open source build automation system. It brings the convenience of a Groovy-based DSL along with the advantages of [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). With Gradle, you can easily manipulate the build process and its logic to create multiple versions of your app. It’s much easier to use and a lot more concise and flexible when compared to Ant or Maven alone.

So, there was little wonder why during Google I/O in May 2013, the __Android Gradle plugin__ was introduced as the build tool built into the first preview of Android Studio

## Getting Started

Download [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-download"/>SocializifyStarter][download-material] the starter project for this tutorial. At minimum, you’ll need Android Studio 3.0 installed on your computer. 

![Open the project in Android Studio and you’ll be prompted to setup the __Gradle wrapper__](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/12/gradle_wrapper-650x172.png)

Choose <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-select"/>`[OK]` to configure the wrapper, which you’ll learn more about later in the tutorial.

![Depending on which version of Android Studio you’re running, you may also be prompted to update the __Gradle plugin__](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/12/gradle_plugin.png)

Choose <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-select"/>`[Update]` to finish opening the project in Android Studio.

Before starting working with the project, let’s review its structure in the __Project__ pane in Android Studio:

![Project structure](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-04-at-11.07.33-PM-443x500.png)

Pay attention to the files with the green Gradle icon and `.gradle` extension. These files are generated by Android Studio automatically during project creation. They are responsible for the processing of your project’s build. They contain the necessary info about the project structure, library dependencies, library versions, and the app versions you’ll get as a result of the build process.

## Where to Go From Here

You can download the final project [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-download"/>here][download-material-final].

The Android Gradle plugin 3.0 contains some significant differences from previous versions. So it’s worth reviewing [the changelog](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-plugin-3-0-0-migration.html).

Also, if you’re insterested in the _Gradle Kotlin DSL_, [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`gradle/kotlin-dsl`](https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/tree/master/samples) you can find a list of usage examples to get familiar with it.
