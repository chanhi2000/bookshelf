By default, Swift is memory safe: It prevents direct access to memory and makes sure you’ve initialized everything before you use it. The key phrase is “by default.” You can also use __unsafe Swift__, which lets you access memory directly through pointers.

This tutorial will take you on a whirlwind tour of the so-called _unsafe_ features of Swift.

Unsafe doesn’t mean dangerously bad code that might not work. Instead, it refers to code that needs extra care because it limits how the compiler can protect you from making mistakes.

These features are useful if you interoperate with an unsafe language such as C, need to gain additional runtime performance or simply want to explore the internals of Swift. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use pointers and interact with the memory system directly.

::: tip Note

While this is an advanced topic, you’ll be able to follow along if you have reasonable competency in Swift. If you need to brush up on your skills, please check out our [iOS and Swift for Beginners](https://www.raywenderlich.com/ios/learn) series. C experience is beneficial but not necessary.

This tutorial consists of three empty Swift playgrounds:

## Exploring Memory Layout With Unsafe Swift

Start by opening the `UnsafeSwift` playground. Since all the code in this tutorial is platform-agnostic, you may select any platform.

![Sample memory addresses](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2017/01/memory-480x214.png)

Unsafe Swift works directly with the memory system. You can visualize memory as a series of boxes — billions of boxes, actually — each containing a number.

Each box has a unique __memory address__. The smallest addressable unit of storage is a __byte__, which usually consists of eight __bits__.

Eight-bit bytes can store values from 0-255. Processors can also efficiently access __words__ of memory, which are typically more than one byte.

On a 64-bit system, for example, a word is 8 bytes or 64 bits. To see this in action, you’ll use `MemoryLayout` to tell you the size and alignment of components of some native Swift types.

Add the following to your playground:

- In the first playground, you’ll use several short snippets of code to explore memory layout. You’ll also give unsafe pointers a try.
- In the second, you’ll take a low-level C API that performs streaming data compression and wrap it with a Swifty interface.
- In the final playground, you’ll create a platform-independent alternative to `arc4random` to generate random numbers. It uses unsafe Swift, but hides that detail from users.

```swift
import Foundation

MemoryLayout<Int>.size          // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<Int>.alignment     // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<Int>.stride        // returns 8 (on 64-bit)

MemoryLayout<Int16>.size        // returns 2
MemoryLayout<Int16>.alignment   // returns 2
MemoryLayout<Int16>.stride      // returns 2

MemoryLayout<Bool>.size         // returns 1
MemoryLayout<Bool>.alignment    // returns 1
MemoryLayout<Bool>.stride       // returns 1

MemoryLayout<Float>.size        // returns 4
MemoryLayout<Float>.alignment   // returns 4
MemoryLayout<Float>.stride      // returns 4

MemoryLayout<Double>.size       // returns 8
MemoryLayout<Double>.alignment  // returns 8
MemoryLayout<Double>.stride     // returns 8
```

`MemoryLayout<Type>` is a generic type evaluated at compile time. It determines the `size`, `alignment` and `stride` of each specified `Type` and returns a number in bytes.

For example, an `Int16` is two bytes in `size` and has an `alignment` of two as well. That means it has to start on even addresses — that is, addresses divisible by two.

For example, it’s legal to allocate an `Int16` at address 100, but not at 101 — an odd number violates the required alignment.

When you pack a bunch of `Int16`s together, they pack at an interval of `stride`. For these basic types, the `size` is the same as the `stride`.

### Examining Struct Layouts

Next, look at the layout of some user-defined `struct`s by adding the following to the playground:

```swift
struct EmptyStruct {}

MemoryLayout<EmptyStruct>.size      // returns 0
MemoryLayout<EmptyStruct>.alignment // returns 1
MemoryLayout<EmptyStruct>.stride    // returns 1

struct SampleStruct {
  let number: UInt32
  let flag: Bool
}

MemoryLayout<SampleStruct>.size       // returns 5
MemoryLayout<SampleStruct>.alignment  // returns 4
MemoryLayout<SampleStruct>.stride     // returns 8
```

The empty structure has a size of zero. It can exist at any address since `alignment` is one and all numbers are evenly divisible by one.

The `stride`, curiously, is one. That’s because each `EmptyStruct` you create has to have a unique memory address, even though its size is zero.

For `SampleStruct`, the `size` is five but the `stride` is eight. That’s because its `alignment` requires it to be on 4-byte boundaries. Given that, the best Swift can do is pack at an interval of eight bytes.

To see how the layout differs for `class` versus `struct`, add the following:

```swift
class EmptyClass {}

MemoryLayout<EmptyClass>.size      // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<EmptyClass>.stride    // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<EmptyClass>.alignment // returns 8 (on 64-bit)

class SampleClass {
  let number: Int64 = 0
  let flag = false
}

MemoryLayout<SampleClass>.size      // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<SampleClass>.stride    // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
MemoryLayout<SampleClass>.alignment // returns 8 (on 64-bit)
```

Classes are reference types, so `MemoryLayout` reports the size of a reference: Eight bytes.

## Using Pointers in Unsafe Swift

A pointer encapsulates a memory address.

Types that involve direct memory access get an _unsafe_ prefix, so the pointer type name is `UnsafePointer`.

The extra typing may seem annoying, but it reminds you that you’re accessing memory that the compiler isn’t checking. When done incorrectly, this could lead to [undefined behavior](http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html), not just a predictable crash.

Swift doesn’t offer just a single `UnsafePointer` type that accesses memory in an unstructured way, like C’s `char *` does. Swift contains almost a dozen pointer types, each with different capabilities and purposes.

You always want to use the most appropriate pointer type for your purpose. This communicates intent better, is less error-prone and avoids undefined behavior.

Unsafe Swift pointers use a predictable naming scheme that describes the pointers’ traits: mutable or immutable, raw or typed, buffer style or not. In total, there are eight pointer combinations. You’ll learn more about them in the following sections.

![Guide to unsafe swift pointers](https://koenig-media.raywenderlich.com/uploads/2016/12/pointers-650x444.png)

## Using Raw Pointers

In this section, you’ll use unsafe Swift pointers to store and load two integers. Add the following code to your playground:

```swift
// 1
let count = 2
let stride = MemoryLayout<Int>.stride
let alignment = MemoryLayout<Int>.alignment
let byteCount = stride * count

// 2
do {
  print("Raw pointers")
  
  // 3
  let pointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
    byteCount: byteCount,
    alignment: alignment)
  // 4
  defer {
    pointer.deallocate()
  }
  
  // 5
  pointer.storeBytes(of: 42, as: Int.self)
  pointer.advanced(by: stride).storeBytes(of: 6, as: Int.self)
  pointer.load(as: Int.self)
  pointer.advanced(by: stride).load(as: Int.self)
  
  // 6
  let bufferPointer = UnsafeRawBufferPointer(start: pointer, count: byteCount)
  for (index, byte) in bufferPointer.enumerated() {
    print("byte \(index): \(byte)")
  }
}
```

Here’s what’s going on:

- __Count__ holds the number of integers to store.
- __Stride__ holds the stride of type `Int`.
- __Alignment__ holds the alignment of type `Int`.
- __ByteCount__ holds the total number of bytes needed.

1. These constants hold frequently used values:
2. A `do` block adds a scope level, so you can reuse the variable names in upcoming examples.
3. `UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate` allocates the required bytes. This method returns an `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`. The name of that type tells you the pointer can load and store, or mutate, raw bytes.
4. A `defer` block makes sure you deallocate the pointer properly. ARC isn’t going to help you here — you need to handle memory management yourself! You can read more about [defer statements](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Statements.html#grammar_defer-statement) in the official Swift documentation.
5. `storeBytes` and `load`, unsurprisingly, store and load bytes. You calculate the memory address of the second integer by advancing the pointer `stride` bytes. Since pointers are `Strideable`, you can also use pointer arithmetic like: `(pointer+stride).storeBytes(of: 6, as: Int.self)`.
6. An `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` lets you access memory as if it were a collection of bytes. This means you can iterate over the bytes and access them using subscripting. You can also use cool methods like `filter`, `map` and `reduce`. You initialize the buffer pointer using the raw pointer.

Even though `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` is unsafe, you can still make it safer by constraining it to specific types.

---

## Using Typed Pointers

You can simplify the previous example by using typed pointers. Add the following code to your playground:

```sh
do {
  print("Typed pointers")
  
  let pointer = UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>.allocate(capacity: count)
  pointer.initialize(repeating: 0, count: count)
  defer {
    pointer.deinitialize(count: count)
    pointer.deallocate()
  }
  
  pointer.pointee = 42
  pointer.advanced(by: 1).pointee = 6
  pointer.pointee
  pointer.advanced(by: 1).pointee
  
  let bufferPointer = UnsafeBufferPointer(start: pointer, count: count)
  for (index, value) in bufferPointer.enumerated() {
    print("value \(index): \(value)")
  }
}
```

Notice the following differences:

- You allocate memory using `UnsafeMutablePointer.allocate`. The generic parameter lets Swift know you’re using the pointer to load and store values of type `Int`.
- You must initialize typed memory before use and deinitialize it after use. You do this using the `initialize` and `deinitialize` methods, respectively. Deinitialization is only required for __non-trivial types__. However, including deinitialization is a good way to future-proof your code in case you change to something non-trivial. It usually doesn’t cost anything since the compiler will optimize it out.
- Typed pointers have a `pointee` property that provides a type-safe way to load and store values.
- When advancing a typed pointer, you can simply state the number of values you want to advance. The pointer can calculate the correct stride based on the type of values it points to. Again, pointer arithmetic also works. You can also say `(pointer+1).pointee = 6`
- The same holds true for typed buffer pointers: They iterate over values instead of bytes.

Next, you’ll learn how to go from unconstrained UnsafeRawBufferPointer to safer, type constrained UnsafeRawBufferPointer.

## Converting Raw Pointers to Typed Pointers

You don’t always need to initialize typed pointers directly. You can derive them from raw pointers as well.

Add the following code to your playground:

```swift
do {
  print("Converting raw pointers to typed pointers")
  
  let rawPointer = UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate(
    byteCount: byteCount,
    alignment: alignment)
  defer {
    rawPointer.deallocate()
  }
  
  let typedPointer = rawPointer.bindMemory(to: Int.self, capacity: count)
  typedPointer.initialize(repeating: 0, count: count)
  defer {
    typedPointer.deinitialize(count: count)
  }

  typedPointer.pointee = 42
  typedPointer.advanced(by: 1).pointee = 6
  typedPointer.pointee
  typedPointer.advanced(by: 1).pointee
  
  let bufferPointer = UnsafeBufferPointer(start: typedPointer, count: count)
  for (index, value) in bufferPointer.enumerated() {
    print("value \(index): \(value)")
  }
}
```

This example is similar to the previous one, except that it first creates a raw pointer. You create the typed pointer by __binding__ the memory to the required type `Int`.

By binding memory, you can access it in a type-safe way. Memory binding goes on behind the scenes when you create a typed pointer.

The rest of this example is also the same as the previous one. Once you’re in typed pointer land, you can make use of `pointee`, for example.

## Getting the Bytes of an Instance

Often, you have an existing instance of a type and you want to inspect the bytes that form it. You can achieve this using a method called `withUnsafeBytes(of:)`.

To do so, add the following code to your playground:

```swift
do {
  print("Getting the bytes of an instance")
  
  var sampleStruct = SampleStruct(number: 25, flag: true)

  withUnsafeBytes(of: &sampleStruct) { bytes in
    for byte in bytes {
      print(byte)
    }
  }
}
```

This prints out the raw bytes of the `SampleStruct` instance.

`withUnsafeBytes(of:)` gives you access to an `UnsafeRawBufferPointer` that you can use inside the closure.

`withUnsafeBytes` is also available as an instance method on `Array` and `Data`.

---

## Computing a Checksum

Using `withUnsafeBytes(of:)`, you can return a result. For example, you might use this to compute a 32-bit checksum of the bytes in a structure.

Add the following code to your playground:

```swift
do {
  print("Checksum the bytes of a struct")
  
  var sampleStruct = SampleStruct(number: 25, flag: true)
  
  let checksum = withUnsafeBytes(of: &sampleStruct) { (bytes) -> UInt32 in
    return ~bytes.reduce(UInt32(0)) { $0 + numericCast($1) }
  }
  
  print("checksum", checksum) // prints checksum 4294967269
}
```

The `reduce` call adds the bytes, then `~` flips the bits. While not the most robust error detection, it shows the concept.

Now that you know how to use unsafe Swift, it’s time to learn some things you should absolutely not do with it.
