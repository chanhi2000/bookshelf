Ahmad Shadeed has done an extensive write-up on Viewport Units:

> In this article, we will learn about CSS viewport units and how to use them, along with some use-cases and solutions for common issues. Let’s start and dig in!

It’s great to see that it’s an all-in-one article, covering use cases such as [**Viewport Unit Based Typography**](/bram.us/viewport-unit-based-typography.md) and [**Breaking Elements out of Their Containers**](/bram.us/breaking-elements-out-of-their-containers-in-css-with-full-bleed.md).

Regarding Mobile Safari (iOS) not properly calculating `100vh` the article mentions [**Louis Hoebregts’ solution**](/css-tricks.com/the-trick-to-viewport-units-on-mobile.md) which uses CSS Custom Properties to correctly set `1vh`. In addition to that I can say [**I’ve had good results using Viewport Units Buggyfill**](/bram.us/making-viewport-units-work-properly-in-mobile-safari.md) in the past. A shame Apple still hasn’t fixed this issue.

  desc="CSS Viewport units have been around for the last few years, and by time, I see them being used more and more by developers. Their benefit lies in providing us with a way to size things in a fluid and dynamic way, without the need to use JavaScript. Also, it’s easy to provide a fallback if they fail."
