For this year’s Google I/O, I recorded the session [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-google"/>“What’s new in web animations”](https://io.google/2023/program/170b44dc-47f0-409f-92fe-b5c70aab4569/).

> Appropriate animations are a great way to help users build an accurate mental model of how a web page UI works and therefore increase usability of a web site. But it’s important for a UI to feel polished and fluid to users. Shipping in Chrome is a collection of new APIs that help you build these frictionless and engaging experiences. Get a highlight of some of these new APIs: view transitions, scroll-driven animations, the linear easing function, and individual transform properties.

In the talk, I cover four topics:

1. [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-chrome"/>View Transitions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/) _(\* written by [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Jake](https://jakearchibald.com/))_
2. [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-chrome"/>Scroll-Driven Animations](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/scroll-driven-animations/)
3. Complex easing curves thanks to `linear()`
4. [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-webdev"/>Individual Transform Properties](https://web.dev/css-individual-transform-properties/)

You can find the video embedded at the top of this post.

Even though I managed to butcher the pronunciation of some words, I’m very happy with how the session turned out. You can hardly notice that we had to fix some things in post as the spec on Scroll-Driven Animations just kept on changing after everything had already been recorded. It was great to be in the London office to record this session, and also getting to spend time with colleagues who I typically only get to see on video calls.

Apart from my video, my team also recorded these videos:

- Una: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>What’s new in web UI](https://youtu.be/buChHSdsF9A)
- Adam: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>How to create personalized web experiences](https://youtu.be/JiVQBqAkkac)
- Jecelyn: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>WebDriver BiDi: Future of browser automation](https://youtu.be/6oXic6dcn9w)

Turning to the wider Chrome DevRel team, I can also recommend Mariko’s talk [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>What’s new in Web](https://youtu.be/x9rh0Du4Czg). Very happy to see that two things I worked on last year – namely [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-webdev"/>Individual Transform Properties](https://web.dev/css-individual-transform-properties/) and [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-webdev"/>the new viewport units](https://web.dev/viewport-units/) – also got highlighted in the video.
