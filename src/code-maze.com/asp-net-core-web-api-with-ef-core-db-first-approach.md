In this article, we’ll take a look at the EF Core Database-First approach. In this approach, we create our database first. We then model our entities. This approach is useful when we work with an existing database. This is also useful when we migrate from existing applications.

A relational database deals with related data. So, we’ll also take a look at different types of relationships in the database and how we can represent those while modeling our entities.

There are 3 types of relationships in relational database design:

- **One-to-One** – A row in **Table A** can have only one matching row in **Table B**, and vice versa.
- **One-to-Many (or Many-to-One)** – A row in **Table A** can have many matching rows in table B, but a row in table B can have only one matching row in **Table A**.
- **Many-to-Many**– A row in **Table A** can have many matching rows in **Table B**, and vice versa.

## Creating a Database and Tables

As the first step, we are going to create the database and tables.

So for example, let’s create a database to manage books. We are going to create tables for storing information about `Books`, `Authors`, `Publishers` etc. and establish relationships between them. 

This is the complete SQL script for creating database tables and relationships.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE BookStore 

GO 

USE BookStore 

GO 

CREATE TABLE Author 
  ( 
     Id   BIGINT IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL, 
     NAME NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
     PRIMARY KEY (Id) 
  ) 

GO 

CREATE TABLE AuthorContact 
  ( 
     AuthorId      BIGINT NOT NULL, 
     ContactNumber NVARCHAR(15) NULL, 
     Address       NVARCHAR(100) NULL, 
     PRIMARY KEY (AuthorId), 
     FOREIGN KEY (AuthorId) REFERENCES Author(Id) 
  ) 

GO 

CREATE TABLE BookCategory 
  ( 
     Id   BIGINT IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL, 
     NAME NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
     PRIMARY KEY (Id) 
  ) 

GO 

CREATE TABLE Publisher 
  ( 
     Id   BIGINT IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL, 
     NAME NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
     PRIMARY KEY (Id) 
  ) 

GO 

CREATE TABLE Book 
  ( 
     Id          BIGINT IDENTITY(1, 1) NOT NULL, 
     Title       NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
     CategoryId  BIGINT NOT NULL, 
     PublisherId BIGINT NOT NULL, 
     PRIMARY KEY (Id), 
     FOREIGN KEY (CategoryId) REFERENCES BookCategory(Id), 
     FOREIGN KEY (PublisherId) REFERENCES Publisher(Id) 
  ) 

GO 

CREATE TABLE BookAuthors 
  ( 
     BookId   BIGINT NOT NULL, 
     AuthorId BIGINT NOT NULL 
     PRIMARY KEY (BookId, AuthorId), 
     FOREIGN KEY (BookId) REFERENCES Book(Id), 
     FOREIGN KEY (AuthorId) REFERENCES Author(Id) 
  )
```

After running the script, we can see the tables and relationships created as below:

![DB Diagram](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/DB_Diagram.jpg)

### Database design explained

#### Tables

- `Author`– Stores the information about the authors.
- `AuthorContact`– Contains the contact information about the authors.
- `Book`– Stores the information about the books.
- `Publisher`– Keeps the information about the publishers.
- `BookCategory`– Keeps the master list of all the categories.
- `BookAuthors`– Represents the mapping between the books and the authors.

#### Relationships

Let’s take a look at how we implement the different types of relationships in our database design.

##### One-to-One(1:1)

In the above design, `Author`and`AuthorContact` have a 1:1 relationship between them. Each entry in the`Author` table has a corresponding entry in the`AuthorContact` table. They are related by the`AuthorId` foreign key.

This type of relationship is not very common. We could also keep the author contact information in the`Author` table. But in certain scenarios, there could be some valid reasons to split out information into different tables like security, performance etc.

##### One-to-Many(1:N)

In the above design, `Publisher`and`Book` have a 1:N relationship between them. A publisher can publish many books, but a book can have only one publisher. They are related by the`PublisherId` foreign key.

This is the most common type of relationship in any database.

##### Many-to-Many(M:N)

In the above design, `Book`and`Author` have an M:N relationships between them. A book can have many authors and at the same time, an author can write many books. They are related by an intermediate table`BookAuthors.` This is also called an associative or junction table.

We can translate an M:N relationship to two 1:N relationships, but linked by an intermediary table.

### Inserting Test Data

Now that we have created our tables and established relationships between them, let’s insert some test data into them. Let’s use the below DB script to insert data:

```sql
INSERT INTO BookCategory
VALUES
('Fantasy Fiction'),
('Spirituality'),
('Fiction'),
('Science Fiction')

INSERT INTO Publisher
VALUES
('HarperCollins'),
('New World Library'),
('Oneworld Publications')

INSERT INTO Author
VALUES
('Paulo Coelho'),
('Eckhart Tolle'),
('Amie Kaufman'),
('Jay Kristoff')

INSERT INTO AuthorContact
VALUES
(1, '111-222-3333', '133 salas 601 / 602, Rio de Janeiro 22070-010. BRAZIL'),
(2, '444-555-6666', '933 Seymour St, Vancouver, BC V6B 6L6, Canada'),
(3, '777-888-9999', 'Mentone 3194. Victoria. AUSTRALIA'),
(4, '222-333-4444', '234 Collins Street, Melbourne, VIC, AUSTRALIA')

INSERT INTO Book
VALUES
('The Alchemist', 1, 1),
('The Power of Now', 2, 2),
('Eleven Minutes', 3, 1),
('Illuminae', 4, 3)

INSERT INTO BookAuthors
VALUES
(1,1),
(2,2),
(3,1),
(4,3),
(4,4)

```

After running the above insert script, our database tables will look like this

## Data Modelling – Creating Models and a Context

So, now we have our database tables with data. Let’s model our entities based on those.

As a first step, let’s set up an ASP.NET Core Web API Project. We have explained this in detail in one of our other articles: [Creating and configuring a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.](/code-maze.com/net-core-web-development-part2.md)

The article linked above covers a lot of additional topics. You may go through the entire article if you want to, but the section linked above is quite enough to follow along with this article.

Following the article linked above, let’s create a new project called`EFCoreDatabaseFirstSample`.

### Creating Models

Now it’s time to create the EF model based on our existing database.

Go to **Tools –>  NuGet Package Manager –>  Package Manager Console**

First, we need to install the following packages :

```pwsh
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

Then, we can create the models from the existing database using `Scaffold-DbContext` command:

```pwsh
Scaffold-DbContext "Server=.;Database=BookStore;Trusted_Connection=True;" 
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models
```

The above command will generate the following classes:

![Generated Classes](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/Generated-Classes.jpg)

`BookStoreContext` is the DB context class and other classes are the models.

Now, let’s look at how EF Core represents the relationships.

#### One-to-One (1:1)

Let’s take a look at the `Author` class:

```csharp
public partial class Author
{
    public Author()
    {
        BookAuthors = new HashSet< BookAuthors> ();
    }

    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual AuthorContact AuthorContact { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection< BookAuthors>  BookAuthors { get; set; }
}
```

Remember that the`Author` has a 1:1 relationship with the`AuthorContact`. To represent this we have an`AuthorContact`property in the`Author` class. This is called the **Navigation Property.**

#### One-to-Many (1:N)

Let’s take a look at the `Publisher` &amp; `Book` classes:

```csharp
public partial class Publisher
{
    public Publisher()
    {
        Books = new HashSet< Book> ();
    }

    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual ICollection< Book>  Books { get; set; }
}
    
public partial class Book
{
    public Book()
    {
        BookAuthors = new HashSet< BookAuthors> ();
    }

    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public long CategoryId { get; set; }
    public long PublisherId { get; set; }

    public virtual BookCategory Category { get; set; }
    public virtual Publisher Publisher { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection< BookAuthors>  BookAuthors { get; set; }
}
```

Remember that the`Publisher`has a 1:N relationship with the`Book`. 

Here, the `Publisher` is called the **Principal Entity** and the `Book` is called **Dependent Entity**.

`Publisher.PublisherId` is the **Principal Key** and `Book.PublisherId` is the **Foreign Key.**

`Publisher.Books` is the **Collection Navigation** property.

`Book`.Publisher is the **Reference Navigation** property.

#### Many-to-Many (M:N) 

::: note

As of now, EF Core does not support many-to-many relationships without using an entity class for representing the join table. However, we can represent it by using an entity class for the join table. We could then map two separate one-to-many relationships.

:::

Let’s take a look at the `Book`, `Author` &amp; `BookAuthors` classes. <em>(`Book` and `Author` classes are already shown above):</em>

```csharp
public partial class BookAuthors
{
    public long BookId { get; set; }
    public long AuthorId { get; set; }

    public virtual Author Author { get; set; }
    public virtual Book Book { get; set; }
}
```

We can see that both the `Book` and the `Author` has a collection navigation property`BookAuthors`. We have established the M:N relationship between the`Book` and the `Author` by these two 1:N relationships.

::: note Recommendation

For an even better understanding of Entity Framework Core, we strongly suggest reading our [Entity Framework Core Series](/code-maze.com/entity-framework-core-series.md). There, you can find a lot of information related to different EF Core features.

## Creating a Repository

Now that we have successfully created the models and context, let’s implement a simple data repository using the repository pattern. We have explained this pattern in detail in one of our other articles: [Implementing the repository pattern](/code-maze.com/net-core-web-development-part4.md). If you get stuck with the code, you can always refer to the mentioned article and to our source code for this article, as well.

Let’s add a new folder under Models and name it `Repository`. We’ll then create a new interface called `IDataRepository`:

```csharp
public interface IDataRepository< TEntity, TDto> 
{
    IEnumerable< TEntity>  GetAll();
    TEntity Get(long id);
    TDto GetDto(long id);
    void Add(TEntity entity);
    void Update(TEntity entityToUpdate, TEntity entity);
    void Delete(TEntity entity);
}
```

We will later inject this interface into our controller. Then the API will communicate with the data context using this interface. Of course, we are going to register all the repo services in the `Startup` class, as you can find out by your self in our source code.

Next, let’s create concrete classes that implement the`IDataRepository` interface. We’ll add a new folder under Models called `DataManager`.

Let’s keep things simple and focus on implementing only the required functions.

### Querying &amp; Loading Related Data

EF Core uses navigation properties in our model to load related entities. We use three common ORM patterns for loading related data.

When we use eager loading, we load the related data from the database as part of the initial query.

Explicit loading means that we load the related data explicitly from the database at a later time.

Lazy loading is a way of loading the related data from the database when we access the navigation property.

#### Eager loading

We can use the`Include`method to specify related data that need to be included in the query results. In the following example, the `Authors` that are returned in the results will have their  `AuthorContacts` property auto-populated.


Let’s add a new class `AuthorDataManager` which implements the`IDataRepository` in the `DataManager` folder, and register it in the `Startup` class.

We’ll then implement the `GetAll()`:

```csharp
public IEnumerable< Author>  GetAll()
{
    return _bookStoreContext.Author
        .Include(author =>  author.AuthorContact)
        .ToList();
}
```

The above code loads all the authors with their contact details at once since we are using eager loading. We shall verify this later when we test it.

#### Explicit loading

We can explicitly load a navigation property using the `DbContext.Entry()`.

Let’s add a new class `BookDataManager` which implements the `IDataRepository` interface and register it in the `Startup` class as well.

We’ll then implement the `Get()`method:

```csharp
public Book Get(long id)
{
    _bookStoreContext.ChangeTracker.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;

    var book = _bookStoreContext.Book
          .SingleOrDefault(b =>  b.Id == id);

    if (book == null)
    {
       return null;
    }

    _bookStoreContext.Entry(book)
        .Collection(b =>  b.BookAuthors)
        .Load();

    _bookStoreContext.Entry(book)
        .Reference(b =>  b.Publisher)
        .Load();
            
    return book;
}
```

The above code is used to get the details of a `Book`. See how we are explicitly loading the list of `BookAuthors` and `Publisher` later. We’ll verify the explicit loading behavior later when we test this functionality.

#### Lazy loading

The simplest way to use lazy-loading is by installing the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies` package and enabling it with a call to `UseLazyLoadingProxies`.

This is shown in the below code

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
    {
        optionsBuilder
            .UseLazyLoadingProxies()
            .UseSqlServer("Server=.;Database=BookStore;Trusted_Connection=True;");
    }
}
```

EF Core will then enable lazy loading for any navigation property that can be overridden. Only thing is that it must be virtual and on a class that can be inherited from.

For example, in the below `Author`class, the `BookAuthors` navigation property will be lazy-loaded:

```csharp
public partial class Author
{
    public long Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public virtual AuthorContact AuthorContact { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection< BookAuthors>  BookAuthors { get; set; }
}
```

Let’s then disable lazy-loading at a context level. This helps to avoid circular referencing issues:

```csharp
public BookStoreContext(DbContextOptions< BooksStoreContext>  options)
    : base(options)
{
    ChangeTracker.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;
}
```

We’ll enable lazy-loading explicitly when we need to utilize it.

Let’s implement the `GetDto()` method in the `AuthorDataManager`class:

```csharp
public AuthorDto GetDto(long id)
{
    _bookStoreContext.ChangeTracker.LazyLoadingEnabled = true;

    using (var context = new BookStoreContext())
    {
       var author = context.Author
           .SingleOrDefault(b =>  b.Id == id);
       return AuthorDtoMapper.MapToDto(author);
    }
}

public class AuthorDto
{
    public AuthorDto()
    {
    }

    public long Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public AuthorContactDto AuthorContact { get; set; }
}

public static class AuthorDtoMapper
{
    public static AuthorDto MapToDto(Author author)
    {
        return new AuthorDto()
        {
            Id = author.Id,
            Name = author.Name,

            AuthorContact = new AuthorContactDto()
            {
                AuthorId = author.Id,
                Address = author.AuthorContact.Address,
                ContactNumber = author.AuthorContact.ContactNumber
            }
        };
    }
}
```

In the code above, since we are using lazy loading, only the `Author` entity will be loaded initially. Later the `AuthorContact` property will be loaded only when we reference it inside the DTO mapper. We’ll verify this behavior later when we test this.

::: note

The referenced property can be lazy-loaded only inside the scope of the data context class. Once the context is out of scope, we will no longer have access to those.

:::

### Saving Related Data

In this section, we’ll explain how we can `Add`, `Update` and `Delete` related entities.

#### Add

If we create several new related entities, adding one of them to the context will cause the others to be added too.

For example, in the below code, let’s implement the `Add()` method in `AuthorDataManager`.

This will cause both `Author` and `AuthorContact` entities to be created:

```csharp
public void Add(Author entity)
{
    _bookStoreContext.Author.Add(entity);
    _bookStoreContext.SaveChanges();
}
```

#### Update

Now let’s implement the update. The below code implements the `Update()` method in `AuthorDataManager` class:

```csharp
public void Update(Author entityToUpdate, Author entity)
{
    entityToUpdate = _bookStoreContext.Author
        .Include(a =>  a.BookAuthors)
        .Include(a =>  a.AuthorContact)
        .Single(b =>  b.Id == entityToUpdate.Id);

    entityToUpdate.Name = entity.Name;

    entityToUpdate.AuthorContact.Address = entity.AuthorContact.Address;
    entityToUpdate.AuthorContact.ContactNumber = entity.AuthorContact.ContactNumber;

    var deletedBooks = entityToUpdate.BookAuthors.Except(entity.BookAuthors).ToList();
    var addedBooks = entity.BookAuthors.Except(entityToUpdate.BookAuthors).ToList();

    deletedBooks.ForEach(bookToDelete => 
        entityToUpdate.BookAuthors.Remove(
            entityToUpdate.BookAuthors
                .First(b =>  b.BookId == bookToDelete.BookId)));

    foreach (var addedBook in addedBooks)
    {
        _bookStoreContext.Entry(addedBook).State = EntityState.Added;
    }

    _bookStoreContext.SaveChanges();
}
```

The above code will cause the `Author`, `AuthorContact`and `BookAuthors` entities to be updated. We’ll verify this later when we test this.

#### Delete

Delete operation can be tricky with related entities. There are three actions EF can take when a parent entity is deleted.

- The child can be deleted
- The child’s foreign key values can be set to null
- The child remains unchanged

We should configure the `DeleteBehavior` appropriately based on our application logic. In the below example, let’s say when a publisher is deleted, we need the publisher’s book also to be deleted.

First, let’s configure this in the `OnModelCreating` method in our context:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity< Book> (entity => 
{
    entity.Property(e =>  e.Title)
        .IsRequired()
        .HasMaxLength(100);

    entity.HasOne(d =>  d.Publisher)
        .WithMany(p =>  p.Books)
        .HasForeignKey(d =>  d.PublisherId)
        .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade)
        .HasConstraintName("FK_Books_Publishers");

    entity.HasOne(d =>  d.Category)
        .WithMany(p =>  p.Book)
        .HasForeignKey(d =>  d.CategoryId)
        .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.ClientSetNull)
        .HasConstraintName("FK_Books_BookCategory");
});
```

Now let’s implement the `Delete()` method in `PublisherDataManager` class:

```csharp
public void Delete(Publisher entity)
{
    _booksStoreContext.Remove(entity);
    _booksStoreContext.SaveChanges();
}
```

The above code will delete the `Publisher`and any related `Book` entities. We’ll verify this later when we test this functionality.

Now we have to register our DataManager classes inside the IOC and configure JSONOptions to ignore circular reference loops.

For that, first, we have to install the NewtonSoftJson package:

```pwsh
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson
```

Then, we can configure the services:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContext< BookStoreContext> (opts =>  opts.UseSqlServer(Configuration["ConnectionString:BooksDB"]));
    services.AddScoped< IDataRepository< Author, AuthorDto> , AuthorDataManager> ();
    services.AddScoped< IDataRepository< Book, BookDto> , BookDataManager> ();
    services.AddScoped< IDataRepository< Publisher, PublisherDto> , PublisherDataManager> ();

    services.AddControllers()
        .AddNewtonsoftJson(
            options =>  options.SerializerSettings.ReferenceLoopHandling = Newtonsoft.Json.ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore
        );
}
```

This is the appsettings.json file:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionString": {
    "BooksDB": "Server=.;Database=BookStore;Trusted_Connection=True"
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

Excellent. Now we can move on.

---

## Creating the API Controller

Now that our DataManager is all set, let’s create the API Controller and create the endpoints for handling CRUD operations. This is described in detail in one of our other articles: [Creating a .NET Core Web API Controller](/code-maze.com/net-core-web-development-part5.md)

Following the above article, let’s create the `AuthorsController`,`BooksController` and `PublishersController` class in the `Controllers` folder as shown below.

For keeping things simple and focused, we’ll implement only those endpoints required to understand the concepts we discuss in this article.

Let’s implement the `GetAll`,`Get`,`Post` and `Put` method in the `AuthorsController`class:

```csharp
[Route("api/authors")]
[ApiController]
public class AuthorsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IDataRepository< Author, AuthorDto>  _dataRepository;

    public AuthorsController(IDataRepository< Author, AuthorDto>  dataRepository)
    {
        _dataRepository = dataRepository;
    }

    // GET: api/Authors
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        var authors = _dataRepository.GetAll();
        return Ok(authors);
    }

    // GET: api/Authors/5
    [HttpGet("{id}", Name = "GetAuthor")]
    public IActionResult Get(int id)
    {
        var author = _dataRepository.GetDto(id);
        if (author == null)
        {
            return NotFound("Author not found.");
        }

        return Ok(author);
    }

    // POST: api/Authors
    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult Post([FromBody] Author author)
    {
        if (author is null)
        {
            return BadRequest("Author is null.");
        }

        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            return BadRequest();
        }

        _dataRepository.Add(author);
        return CreatedAtRoute("GetAuthor", new { Id = author.Id }, null);
    }

    // PUT: api/Authors/5
    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Put(int id, [FromBody] Author author)
    {
        if (author == null)
        {
            return BadRequest("Author is null.");
        }

        var authorToUpdate = _dataRepository.Get(id);
        if (authorToUpdate == null)
        {
            return NotFound("The Employee record couldn't be found.");
        }

        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            return BadRequest();
        }

        _dataRepository.Update(authorToUpdate, author);
        return NoContent();
    }
}

```

Then let’s implement the `Get()` method in the `BooksController`:

```csharp
[Route("api/books")]
[ApiController]
public class BooksController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IDataRepository< Book, BookDto>  _dataRepository;

    public BooksController(IDataRepository< Book, BookDto>  dataRepository)
    {
        _dataRepository = dataRepository;
    }

    // GET: api/Books/5
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Get(int id)
    {
        var book = _dataRepository.Get(id);
        if (book == null)
        {
            return NotFound("Book not found.");
        }

        return Ok(book);
    }
}

```

Finally, let’s implement the `Delete()` method in the `PublisherController`:

```csharp
[Route("api/publishers")]
[ApiController]
public class PublishersController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IDataRepository< Publisher, PublisherDto>  _dataRepository;

    public PublishersController(IDataRepository< Publisher, PublisherDto>  dataRepository)
    {
        _dataRepository = dataRepository;
    }

    // DELETE: api/ApiWithActions/5
    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public IActionResult Delete(int id)
    {
        var publisher = _dataRepository.Get(id);
        if (publisher == null)
        {
            return NotFound("The Publisher record couldn't be found.");
        }

        _dataRepository.Delete(publisher);
        return NoContent();
    }
}

```

::: note Recommendation

If you want to learn in great detail about Entity Framework Core and many of its features, we recommend going through our [Entity Framework Core series.](/code-maze.com/entity-framework-core-series.md) Through the entire series, we talk about different EF Core features, from the Context classes and DbSet properties, relationships and none-relational configurations, additional migration information and querying the database. If you want, you have a place to learn a lot more on this topic.

## Testing the API

Now we’ll test the controller methods using Postman. We’ll also verify the results in the database. Later, we’ll inspect the actual SQL queries executed in the database using the SQL Server Profiler.

### Loading the Data

First, let’s test the `GetAll` endpoint of `Authors:`

![GET All Authors](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/GET_All_Authors.jpg)

Remember that we used eager loading for implementing this functionality. If we look at the Profiler, we can see that the query fetches data by joining `Author` and `AuthorContact` tables:

![GetAll Profiler](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/GetAll_Profiler.jpg)

Next, let’s test the `Get` endpoint of the `Book:`

![GET Book](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/GET_Book.jpg)

Remember that we used explicit loading to implement this functionality. Here note that only those properties that we chose to load explicitly have data. Other related properties are empty.

In the Profiler, we can see that initially, an SQL query fetches data from the `Book` table. Later, queries are generated to fetch data from other tables when we explicitly load data from other entities.

![GET Book Profiler](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/GET_Book_Profiler.jpg)

Now, let’s test the `Get` endpoint of `Author`:

![Get Author](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/Get_Author.jpg)

Remember that we used lazy loading to implement this functionality. In the Profiler, we can see that initially only data from the `Author` table is loaded. Later, when we refer the `AuthorContact` entity inside the DTO Mapper class, another query loads data from the `AuthorContact` table:

![Get_Author_Profiler)ads/2018/10](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/Get_Author_Profiler.jpg)

### Updating Data

Now, let’s test the `Add` endpoint of `Author`:

![POST_Author](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/POST_Author-3.jpg)

We can see that two INSERT queries are generated to insert data into tables `Author` and `AuthorContact`:

![INSERT_Profiler](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/INSERT_Profiler.jpg)

We can verify that our Add endpoint inserts data in both tables:

![DB_Result_After_POST](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/DB_Result_After_POST-1.jpg)

Now let’s test the `Update` endpoint of `Authors`.

We’ll insert some data into `Publisher`,`BookCategory` and `Book` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Publisher
VALUES
('Simon &amp; Schuster'),
('Oxford University Press')


INSERT INTO BookCategory
VALUES
('Tragedy'),
('Romance')


INSERT INTO Book
VALUES
('Hamlet', 5, 4),
('Romeo and Juliet', 6, 5)

```

Let’s modify the `Author` we just inserted. Let’s edit the `ContactNumber` and map the newly added `Books` to this author:

![POST_Author](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/POST_Author.jpg)

In the Profiler, we can see an `UPDATE` query for the `AuthorContact` table and two `INSERT` queries for the `BookAuthors` table:

![UPDATE_Profiler](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/UPDATE_Profiler.jpg)

Let’s verify the results in the database:

![DB_Result_After_PUT](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/DB_Result_After_POST.jpg)

Finally, let’s test the `Delete` endpoint of `Publisher`.

We’ll insert a test publisher and two related books:

```csharp
INSERT INTO Publisher
VALUES
('My Publisher')

INSERT INTO Book
VALUES
('My Publisher Book 1', 5, 6),
('My Publisher Book 2', 4, 6)

```

Now let’s test the `Delete` endpoint.

![DELETE_Publisher](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/DELETE_Publisher.jpg)

In the Profiler, we can see that the related data is first removed from the`Book` table. Then the publisher record is deleted from the`Publisher` table.

![DELETE_Profiler](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/DELETE_Profiler.jpg)

Let’s verify the changes in the database.

![DB_Result_After_DELETE](/assets/image/code-maze.com/asp-net-core-web-api-with-ef-core-db-first-approach/DB_Result_After_DELETE.jpg)
