<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
By default `AVAudioPlayer` plays its audio from start to finish then stops, but you can control how many times to make it loop by setting its `numberOfLoops` property. For example, to make your audio play five times in total, you’d write this:

```swift
audioPlayer.numberOfLoops = 5
```

You can also set this property to -1, which automatically causes `AVAudioPlayer` to loop the sound forever.
