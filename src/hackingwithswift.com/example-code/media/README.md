  "desc": "Core Image has a number of feature detectors built right in, including the ability to detect faces, eyes, mouths, smiles and even blinking in pictures. When you ask it to look for faces in a picture, it will return you an array of all the faces it found, with each one containing face feature details such as eye position. Here's an example:",

  "title": "How to create a QR code",
  "desc": "iOS has a built-in QR code generator, but it's a bit tricksy to use because it's exposed as a Core Image filter that needs various settings to be applied. Also, it generates codes where every bit is just one pixel across, which looks terrible if you try to stretch it inside an image view.",

  "desc": "One of the most useful filters to have in your toolbox is called <code>CIColorMonochrome</code>, and its job is to remove the color variance from an image then tint it however you want. If you use gray as your tint color, it produces plain black and white images, but you can also use other colors to get sepia tone and other effects.",

  "desc": "iOS has text-to-speech synthesis built right into the system, but even better is that it allows you to track when individual words are being spoken so that you can highlight the words on the screen. This is extremely easy to do thanks to the <code>AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate</code> protocol: you get two callbacks in the form of <code>willSpeakRangeOfSpeechString</code> and <code>didFinish</code>, where you can do your work.",

  "desc": "If you use a small image in a large image view, you can make the image stretch to fit if you want to but it probably won't look great. iOS provides an alternative known as <em>resizable images</em>, which is where you define part of an image as being fixed in size and let iOS stretch the remainder.",

  "title": "How to play sounds using AVAudioPlayer",
  "desc": "The most common way to play a sound on iOS is using <code>AVAudioPlayer</code>, and it's popular for a reason: it's easy to use, you can stop it whenever you want, and you can adjust its volume as often as you need. The only real catch is that you must store your player as a property or other variable that won't get destroyed straight away - if you don't, the sound will stop immediately.",

What's more, it's not just for games - you can record any kind of app just fine. I should add, though, that the recording quality is fairly low, so it's not worth trying to record fine details.",
