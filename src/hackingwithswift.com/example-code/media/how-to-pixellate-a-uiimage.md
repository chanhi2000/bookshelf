Core Image has a number of interesting filters baked in, and an easy one to use is `CIPixellate` - it pixellates images, making them appear blocky. You have control over how big each pixel block should be, so it’s suitable for a range of tasks.

Below is some sample code to get you started. To use it you should:

1. Change `yourUIImage` to be whatever input `UIImage` you want to use.
<li>Change the value of 12 for however strong your pixellation effect should be.
<li>Change the `print(processedImage.size)` line at the end for something more interesting - maybe you want to display the pixellated image somewhere?

Here’s the code:

```swift
guard let currentCGImage = yourUIImage.cgImage else { return }
let currentCIImage = CIImage(cgImage: currentCGImage)

let filter = CIFilter(name: "CIPixellate")
filter?.setValue(currentCIImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
filter?.setValue(12, forKey: kCIInputScaleKey)
guard let outputImage = filter?.outputImage else { return }

let context = CIContext()

if let cgimg = context.createCGImage(outputImage, from: outputImage.extent) {
    let processedImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgimg)
    print(processedImage.size)
}
```

Note: if you intend to run pixellation several times you’ll find it more efficient to save your `CIContext` rather than keep recreating it.
