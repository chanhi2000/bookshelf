<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
A `CGAffineTransform` value combines scale, translation and rotation all at once, but if you just want to know its rotation value is then use this code:

```swift
func rotation(from transform: CGAffineTransform) -> Double {
    return atan2(Double(transform.b), Double(transform.a))
}
```
