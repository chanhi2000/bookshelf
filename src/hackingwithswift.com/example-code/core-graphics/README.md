  "title": "How to calculate the distance between two CGPoints",
  "desc": "You can calculate the distance between two <code>CGPoints</code> by using Pythagoras's theorem, but be warned: calculating square roots is not fast, so if possible you want to avoid it. More on that in a moment, but first here's the code you need:...",

  "title": "How to calculate the Manhattan distance between two CGPoints",
  "desc": "Manhattan distance is the distance between two integer points when you are unable to move diagonally. It's named 'Manhattan distance' because of the grid-like layout of New York: whether you go four streets up then five streets across, or five streets across then four streets up, or you zig zag to and fro, the actual end distance is identical because you're just moving across a grid....",

  "desc": "You could compare two <code>CGRect</code> values by evaluating their X, Y, width and height values, but there's a much faster way: <code>equalTo()</code>. This takes two rects as its only two parameters and returns true if they are the same, or false otherwise....",

{
  "title": "How to draw a text string using Core Graphics",
  "desc": "To draw text in Core Graphics is trivial because every Swift string has a built-in <code>draw(with:)</code> method that takes an array of attributes and a position and size. There is, like always, some Core Graphics set up work to do, but this next code snippet is a complete example you can re-use easily:...",

  "desc": "You can draw lines in Core Graphics using <code>move(to:)</code> and <code>addLine(to:)</code>. The first function moves the Core Graphics path to a <code>CGPoint</code> of your choosing, and the second function moves the path to a new point while also adding a line. Once you add in the required code to set up a context and choose a color, you can draw a triangle with this code:...",

  "title": "How to render a PDF to an image",
  "desc": "iOS has built-in APIs for drawing PDFs, which means it's relatively straight forward to render a PDF to an image.
