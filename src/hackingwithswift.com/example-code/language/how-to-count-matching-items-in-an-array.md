<!-- 
If you want to count how many items in an array (or any collection) match a test you specify, the easiest thing to do is run the collection through a call to `filter()` then count the remainder.

For example, if you had an array of numbers and wanted to count how many were odd, you would write this:

```swift
let count1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].filter { $0 % 2 == 1 }.count
```

Because this is something that all collections might want to do, you should consider wrapping it in an extension on `Collection`, like this:

```swift
extension Collection {
    func count(where test: (Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Int {
        return try self.filter(test).count
    }
}
```

With that change, counting the odd numbers becomes this:

```swift
let count2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].count { $0 % 2 == 1 }
```
