<!-- 
Swift has a dedicated `Substring` type (`String.SubSequence`) that is designed to hold slices of strings, which is a performance optimization: when you store part of a string in a different variable, Swift can simply point the substring at the parent string rather than copy all the data.

However, while substrings can be used in many of the same ways as regular strings, they aren’t the same - if you have a function that accepts a `String` as a parameter, you simply cannot send it a `Substring`.

To fix this, you can wrap your substring in a `String` initializer like this:

```swift
let quote = "The revolution will be Swift"
let substring = quote.dropFirst(23)
let realString = String(substring)
```
