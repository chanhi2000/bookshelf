<!-- 
`NSNumber` is an Objective-C class designed to store a variety of types of numbers. It was important in Objective-C because its primitive number types - integers, doubles, etc - could not be used in most of Apple’s APIs without wrapping them in an object such as `NSNumber`, but mostly Swift does a good job of automatically converting its numbers to `NSNumber` when you need it.

That being said, there are a few times when Swift won’t help you out, and you need to convert to `NSNumber` by hand. For example, this code is designed to convert numerical numbers like 50 into textual numbers like “fifty”, but it won’t compile:

```swift
let number = 50
let formatter = NumberFormatter()
formatter.numberStyle = .spellOut

// this line won't work
// let string1 = formatter.string(from: number) ?? ""
```

The problem is that the `string(from:)` method expects an `NSNumber` and Swift isn’t able to automatically bridge the integer we created in `number`. The fix here is nice and easy - just add `as NSNumber` to help Swift bridge the two worlds:

```swift
let string2 = formatter.string(from: number as NSNumber) ?? ""
```
