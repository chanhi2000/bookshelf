<!-- 
Nested types – i.e. nested structs and nested classes – are a useful way of organizing your code, and perhaps even restricting what others can do with it. In essence, a nested type is just one data type defined inside another, like this:

```swift
struct Deck {
    struct Card {

    }
}
```

Now rather than creating a new `Card` struct you would instead create a new `Deck.Card` because one is inside the other.

This approach is useful for organizing larger applications, because you might need custom types that are applicable only in certain places – exposing them elsewhere might cause problems.

If you want to re-enforce this, Swift lets you mark the inner type (`Card` above) as being private, which means it can only be used inside the `Deck` class – code from outside `Deck` can’t even see it.
