<!-- 
The `@autoclosure` attribute can be applied to a closure parameter for a function, and automatically creates a closure from an expression you pass in. When you call a function that uses this attribute, the code you write *isn't* a closure, but it *becomes* a closure, which can be a bit confusing - even the official Swift reference guide warns that overusing autoclosures makes your code harder to understand.

To help you understand how it works, here's a trivial example:

```swift
func printTest1(_ result: () -> Void) {
    print("Before")
    result()
    print("After")
}

printTest1({ print("Hello") })
```

That code creates a `printTest()` method, which accepts a closure and calls it. As you can see, the `print("Hello")` is inside a closure that gets called between "Before" and "After", so the final output is "Before", "Hello", "After".

If we used `@autoclosure` instead, it would allow us to rewrite the `printTest()` call so that it doesn't need braces, like this:

```swift
func printTest2(_ result: @autoclosure () -> Void) {
    print("Before")
    result()
    print("After")
}

printTest2(print("Hello"))
```

These two pieces of code produce identical results thanks to `@autoclosure`. In the second code example, the `print("Hello")` won't be executed immediately because it gets wrapped inside a closure for execution later.

The `@autoclosure` attribute is used inside Swift wherever code needs to be passed in and executed only if conditions are right. For example, the `&&` operator uses `@autoclosure` to allow short-circuit evaluation, and the `assert()` function uses it so that the assertion isn’t checked outside of debug mode.
