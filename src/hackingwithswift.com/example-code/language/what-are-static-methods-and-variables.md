<!-- 
Static methods and variables belong to the type that defined them, rather than instances of that type. For example, we could create a struct to track taxis in a city, like this:

```swift
struct Taxi1 {
    var ownerName: String
    var licensePlate: String
}
```

Each instance of that struct will have its own `ownerName` and `licensePlate` property strings. However, if we made a *static* property inside that struct then it would be shared by all taxis. For example, we could add this property to store how many taxis exist in the city:

```swift
struct Taxi2 {
    var ownerName: String
    var licensePlate: String
    static var count: Int = 0
}
```

When we want to reference that property we need to use `Taxi2.count`, because it belongs to the struct not to instances of that struct.

The same is true of static methods, which are sometimes called “type methods” – they belong to the struct or class that defined them rather than instance of the class. In practice that means you can’t use `self` inside the method because there is no instance to refer to.
