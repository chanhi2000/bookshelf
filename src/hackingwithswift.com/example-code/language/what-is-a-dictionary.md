<!-- 
A dictionary is a collection of values stored at named positions. Whereas you would access values in an array using `myArray[5]`, with a dictionary you use named positions such as `myDict["Paul"]` or `myDict["Scotland"]`. You don't even need to use strings for the positions – you can use another object if you choose, such as dates.

These named positions are called "keys", so dictionaries represent what's known as a key-value pair: each key has exactly one value, and each can appear only once in a dictionary.
