<!-- 
All arrays have a built-in method called `max()`, which returns the highest item in the array. This comes with a default implementation if the elements of the array conform to `Comparable`: it will simply compare all items until it finds the one that compares highest.

For example, this code puts 5 into the `max` constant:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let max = numbers.max()
```

Note: because `max()` can be called on an empty array, it returns an *optional* - you need to check and unwrap it yourself.
