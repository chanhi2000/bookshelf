<!-- 
Swift’s type safety means code to multiply an integer and a double won’t compile:

```swift
let a = 4
let b = 5.0
let c = a * b
```

You can either fix this by forcing your integer to be a double:

```swift
let d: Double = 4
let e = 5.0
let f = a * b
```

Alternatively you can convert your integer to a double as needed:

```swift
let g = 4
let h = 5.0
let i = Double(a) * b
```

If this situation really annoys you and you want it solved fully, add this custom `*` function:

```swift
func *(lhs: Int, rhs: Double) -> Double {
    return Double(lhs) * rhs
}
```

That will multiply an integer on the left with a double on the right, returning a double containing the result.
