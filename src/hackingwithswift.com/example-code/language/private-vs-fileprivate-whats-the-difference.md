<!-- 
These two forms of access control are similar, but there are two differences.

If you mark something `fileprivate` it can be read anywhere in the same file it was declared - even outside the type. On the other hand, a `private` property can only be read inside the type that declared it, or inside extensions to that type that were created in the same file.

In practice you’re likely to see `private` used significantly more than `fileprivate`.
