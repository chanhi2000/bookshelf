The `guard` keyword was introduced in Swift to signal early returns, which is a coding technique that effectively means "make sure all these things are set up before I start doing the real work in my function, others bail out."

For example, if you want to ensure a `submit()` is only ever run if an existing `name` property has a value, you would do this:

```swift
func submit() {
    guard name != nil else { return }

    doImportantWork(name)
}
```

This might seem like a job for a regular `if` statement, and to be fair that's correct - the two are very similar. The advantage with `guard`, however, is that it makes your intention clear: these values need to be set up correctly before continuing.

The `guard` keyword is also helpful because it can be used to check and unwrap optionals that remain unwrapped until the end of the method. For example:

```swift
func betterSubmit() {
    guard let unwrappedName = name else { return }

    doImportantWork(unwrappedName)
}
```

So, if `name` is `nil` the method will return; otherwise, it will be safely unwrapped into `unwrappedName`.
