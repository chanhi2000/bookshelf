<!-- 
Sets and arrays both store objects of your choosing, but they have four important differences:

1. Sets do not store objects in the order they add them.
<li>Instead, they are stored in a way to make them fast to find, which means finding items in sets is extremely efficient.
<li>Sets store each item precisely once.
<li>All items you want to store in a set must conform to `Hashable`.

As a result, you should use a set rather than an array if all the following criteria are true:

1. You intend to add each item only once. Sets never allow duplicates.
<li>You don’t care about the order of the items in the set.
<li>You don’t need to use APIs that require arrays.
<li>You’re storing `Hashable` types, either your own or one of Swift’s built-in types likes strings and integers. Sets use hash values for fast look up of items.

You can switch between an array and a set simply enough:

```swift
let array = [1, 2, 3]
let set = Set(array)
let array2 = Array(set)
```

Using `contains()` on a set takes the same amount of time if you have one item as it does if you have one thousand items - it’s called an O(1) operation.
