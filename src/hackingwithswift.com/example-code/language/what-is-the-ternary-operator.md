<!-- 
The ternary operator allows you to run a check and return one of two values depending on the result of that check - it has the name “ternary” because it works with three values rather than two or one like other operators. You’ll often see it written as `?:` but in practice the `?` and `:` are used separately.

Like I said, the ternary operator is used with three values: the check to run, what to return if the check is true, and what to return if the check is false. For example, if we had a `score` constant that contained an integer, we could make a `result` constant equal either to “Pass” or “Fail” depending on the value of `score`:

```swift
let score = 88
let result = score > 85 ? "Pass" : "Fail"
```

You can read that ternary as “if score is greater than 85 return Pass otherwise return Fail.” Because `score` was set to 88, `result` will be set to Pass.

The ternary operator usually makes your code harder to read and understand, so it doesn’t get much use.
