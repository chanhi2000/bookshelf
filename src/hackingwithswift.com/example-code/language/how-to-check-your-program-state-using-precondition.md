You should already know that the `assert()` function lets you check the state of your program at runtime, and crash if things aren’t how they should be. One of the neat features of `assert()` is that it automatically gets removed when you build your app in release mode, but if you don’t want that to happen - if you want your app to crash if something is seriously wrong - then you should use the `precondition()` function instead.

`precondition()` works identically to `assert()`: give it a condition to check along with an optional message to print if the check fails. At runtime - even in release mode - Swift will run the check for you and crash if the check fails.

For example:

```swift
precondition(users.count > 0, "There must be at least one user.")
```

Whereas `assert()` should be used liberally to make sure your program is always in a sane state, `precondition()` should be used much more infrequently because it will still crash your app in release mode. That’s not always a bad thing, particularly if bad state means something is seriously corrupted, but you should definitely use it more carefully.
