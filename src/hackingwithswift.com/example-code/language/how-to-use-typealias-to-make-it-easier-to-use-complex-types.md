<!-- 
Although it’s generally a good idea to use structs or classes for defining your types, sometimes you’ll find yourself using tuples. If this happens to you, it’s quite tedious having to type the full definition of your tuple whenever you want to use it, so the `typealias` lets you create a specific name for it:

```swift
typealias Name = (first: String, last: String)
```

Type aliases are also useful when you might want to change the underlying type used for data. For example, you might store a value as a `Float` today, but you want to leave open the option to switch to a `Double` later on. In this situation, you’d use `typealias` like this:

```swift
typealias MyValue = Float
```

You can then go ahead and use `MyValue` everywhere in your code, and if you ever choose to change to `Double` you can just change the type alias and all your code will update.
