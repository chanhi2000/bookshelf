<!-- 
Like regular functions, closures can accept values and return values of your choosing: just write them out at the start of your closure, followed by the word `in`.

For example, we could write a `greeting` closure that accepts the name of a person to greet and returns a string using that name:

```swift
let greeting = { (name: String) -> String in
    return "Hello, \(name)!"
}
```

You can now call that just like any other function, passing in someone’s name as its only parameter:

```swift
let message = greeting("Taylor")
```
