Protocol associated types let you add a huge amount of flexibility to your protocols, but sometimes you want a little *less* flexibility. For example, you might say that all types conforming to a protocol must specify the `id` of their object and also what type that ID must be:

```swift
protocol Identifiable1 {
    associatedtype ID
    var id: ID { get set }
}
```

With that code, `ID` could be anything – a `String`, an `Int`, a `UILabel`, and so on. However, you might find you need to apply some constraints to that type: perhaps you need to use it as a dictionary key (`Hashable`), or sort it in an array (`Comparable`).

To make this work, Swift lets us apply constraints to associated types: “it can be any type, as long as that type conforms to…”. For example, this forces `ID` to conform to `Hashable`:

```swift
protocol Identifiable2 {
    associatedtype ID: Hashable
    var id: ID { get set }
}
```

Because `Hashable` inherits from `Equatable` we can now be sure that any types used for `ID` can be compared using `==` and also used as keys in dictionaries.
