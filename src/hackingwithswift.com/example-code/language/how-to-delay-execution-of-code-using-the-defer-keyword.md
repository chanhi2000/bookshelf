<!-- 
The `defer` keyword is new in Swift 2 and lets you schedule some code to be run at a later date. That later date is when your code exits its current scope, which might be when a function returns or at the end of a loop, for example.

If you've used other programming languages, `defer` will seem similar to `try/finally`. Any code you defer will run no matter what, even if you throw an exception.

In the example code below, the `closeFile()` function will get called no matter how the `writeLog()` function ends:

```swift
func writeLog() {
    let file = openFile()
    defer { closeFile(file) }

    let hardwareStatus = fetchHardwareStatus()
    guard hardwareStatus != "disaster" else { return }
    file.write(hardwareStatus)

    let softwareStatus = fetchSoftwareStatus()
    guard softwareStatus != "disaster" else { return }
    file.write(softwareStatus)

    let networkStatus = fetchNetworkStatus()
    guard networkStatus != "disaster" else { return }
    file.write(networkStatus)
}
```
