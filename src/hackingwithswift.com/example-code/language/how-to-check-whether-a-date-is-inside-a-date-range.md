<!-- 
Everyone knows you can create ranges from two integers such as `1...5`, but few people realize the same applies to dates. This means you can create a date range using the same closed-range operator (`...`) and half-open range operator (`..<`) you already know, allowing you to check whether one date lies inside a range.

For example, we could create three `Date` objects like this:

```swift
let now = Date.now
let soon = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(5000)
let later = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(10000)
```

We can then compare `now` and `later` into a single range like this:

```swift
let range = now...later
```

Finally, we can check whether that range contains the `soon` date using the `contains()` method of ranges, like this:

```swift
if range.contains(soon) {
    print("The date is inside the range")
} else {
    print("The date is outside the range")
}
```
