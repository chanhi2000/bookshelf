<!-- 
By default Swift generates code that is only available to other Swift code, but if you need to interact with the Objective-C runtime – all of UIKit, for example – you need to tell Swift what to do.

If you just want to expose a single method or property, you can mark that method using the `@objc` attribute. However, if you want *all* methods in a class to be exposed to Objective-C you can use a shortcut: the `@objcMembers` keyword:

```swift
@objcMembers class MyController: UIViewController {
    func login() {

    }
}
```

In that code, the `login()` method will automatically be exposed to Objective-C in the same way as if it had been marked with `@objc`, because the whole class it’s inside is marked with `@objcMembers`.
