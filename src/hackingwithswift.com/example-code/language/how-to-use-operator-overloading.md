Operator overloading is the practice of adding new operators and modifying existing ones to do different things. Operators are those little symbols like `+`, `*`, and `/`, and Swift uses them in a variety of ways depending on context – a string plus another string equals a combined string, for example, whereas an integer plus another integer equals a summed integer.

To create your own operator you need to tell Swift whether it should be *prefix* (before its operand; the values used with it), *postfix* (after its operand), or *infix*. The most common is infix: `+`, `-`, `*`, and more are all infix.

To create a new operator, try adding this to a playground:

```swift
infix operator **
```

That’s the exponentiation operator, designed to raise one number to the power of another. Normally we’d use the `pow()` function for that job, but with operator overloading we can make `**` work instead.

Now you need to tell Swift what to do when it sees that operator. For example, when we write something like `2 ** 4` what does that *mean*?

What Swift wants is a function called `**`, the name of our operator, where the left-hand side is one type and the right-hand side is another type. Which type is down to us, but `**` is normally used with a `Double` on either side, so we’re going to write a function that accepts two doubles and returns a double:

```swift
func **(lhs: Double, rhs: Double) -> Double {
    return pow(lhs, rhs)
}
```

As you can see, the function itself is a cinch thanks to `pow()` – we literally just pass on the numbers. Now this code should work in your playground:

```swift
let result = 2 ** 4
```

For more advanced uses, you also need to specify associativity and a precedence group, but what we have is fine to start with.
