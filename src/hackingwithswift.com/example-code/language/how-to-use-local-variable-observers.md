<!-- 
You should already be familiar with the concept of property observers in Swift – those `willSet` and `didSet` blocks you can attach to property on classes and structs. Well, those same blocks can be attached to local and global variables as well, allowing you to respond to changes easily.

The syntax is identical: create your variable, give it an initial value, then provide `willSet` and/or `didSet` closures inside braces, like this:

```swift
var name = "Taylor Swift" {
    didSet {
        print("Name changed to \(name)!")
    }
}

name = "Justin Bieber"
```

That will print “Name changed to Justin Bieber!” when run.
