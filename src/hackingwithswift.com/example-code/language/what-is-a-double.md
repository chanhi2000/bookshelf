<!-- 
The `Double` data type is the standard Swift way of storing decimal numbers such as 3.1, 3.14159 and 16777216.333921. Whenever you create a variable or constant that holds a number like this, Swift automatically assumes it's a `Double` rather than a `Float`, because it has a higher precision and therefore less likely to lose valuable accuracy.
