Option sets are similar to enums, but they are designed to work as a set so you can use more than one at a time. For example, when using the `range(of:)` method of a string, you can specify `.caseInsensitive` to have the search ignore case, you can specify `.backwards` to have the search start from the end of the string, or you can combine the two:

```swift
let string = "The rain in Spain"
let range = string.range(of: "rain", options: [.caseInsensitive, .backwards])
```

That searches through the string backwards and ignoring case - we provided both options at the same time. This functionality looks like an enum, but it can also be treated as an array; Swift figures it out for you.

You can write your own by making a custom struct that conforms to the `OptionSet` protocol, and it doesn’t take much:

1. Create a constant describing what the underlying value is - it’s normally an integer, but you need to be specific. 
<li>Make static instances of your struct for each option you want to represent.
<li>Each of those should have a unique raw value, so its common to use bit-shifting to avoid mistakes.
<li>Add any groups of those instances as new statics.

To demonstrate this, let’s create a `UserRoles` struct that defines roles a user might have in a GitHub account: they can create things, destroy things, and get the status of things.

All three of those roles need unique raw values, so we’re going to use bit shifting - `1 << 0`, `1 << 1`, and so on - to make that clear.

Here’s how it looks in Swift:

```swift
struct UserRoles: OptionSet {
    let rawValue: Int

    static let status = UserRoles(rawValue: 1 << 0)
    static let create = UserRoles(rawValue: 1 << 1)
    static let destroy = UserRoles(rawValue: 1 << 2)
    static let all: UserRoles = [.status, .create, .destroy]
}
```

You can now use any of those roles by themselves or in an array:

```swift
let roles1: UserRoles = [.create]
let roles2: UserRoles = [.create, .destroy]
let roles3: UserRoles = [.create, .destroy, .status]
let roles4 = UserRoles.all
```
