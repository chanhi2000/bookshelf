<!-- 
When you use `JSONEncoder` and `Codable` to create JSON from your Swift data, your properties are not guaranteed to be written out in any particular order. This is usually fine, because relying on key ordering in your JSON is almost certainly a bad idea. However, if you’re debugging a large type and it’s hard to dig through keys to find what you want, `JSONEncoder` has the perfect option for you: you can sort your JSON keys alphabetically.

To make it happen, change the `outputFormatting` property of your `JSONEncoder` object to be `.sortedKeys`, like this:

```swift
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.outputFormatting = .sortedKeys
```

Now any JSON you produce will use alphabetical order for your keys, based on the names of each of your properties.
