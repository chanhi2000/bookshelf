Generics are a way of making one data type act in a variety of ways depending on how it is created. You’ve already used them whether you realized or not: Swift has an `Array` type, but it is *generic* - it doesn’t contain any sort of specific data. Instead, you ask for arrays that hold specific kinds of data by using things like `[String]` to get a string array.

It’s not hard to create generics of your own, and to demonstrate that we’re going to create a simple `Queue` type. These are first-in, first-out data structures (FIFO), which means you add things to the back and remove them from the front - much like a real-life queue.

We want this queue to be generic, and in Swift you do that by writing the name of a generic placeholder inside angle brackets, like this: `struct Queue<T> {`. That `T` doesn’t mean anything special - it could have been `R` or `Element` - but `T` is commonly used.

Inside the queue we’re going to have an internal array tracking the items we’re storing, and we’ll write methods to add and remove items.

Here’s the complete `Queue` struct:

```swift
struct Queue<T> {
    private var internalArray = [T]()

    var count: Int {
        return internalArray.count
    }

    mutating func add(_ item: T) {
        internalArray.append(item)
    }

    mutating func remove() -> T? {
        if internalArray.count > 0 {
            return internalArray.removeFirst()
        } else {
            return nil
        }
    }
}
```

You can now create a queue to store any object you want. For example, this create a queue of integers:

```swift
let queue = Queue<Int>()
```
