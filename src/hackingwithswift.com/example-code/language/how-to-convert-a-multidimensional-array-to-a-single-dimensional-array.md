<!-- 
If you have an array of arrays - for example, an array of an array of integers - you can convert it to a single, flat array by using the `joined()` method. Because Swift sends back an optimized type (`FlattenSequence<[[YourType]]>`, in this case), you might also want to add an array conversion for easier use.

For example, here’s an array of arrays of strings, such as you might find if you had one array for each class of students, grouped into a larger array to represent the whole school:

```swift
let classes = [
    ["Ash", "Brock", "Misty"],
    ["Gloria", "Piper", "Suzanne"],
    ["Picard", "Riker", "Troi"]
]
```

We can use `joined()` to get a single array of names like this:

```swift
let allStudents = classes.joined()
```

As noted, that will make `allStudents` an instance of `FlattenSequence<[[String]]>` rather than an array, so if you need to send it back from a method or want to subscript it you should convert it to an array first, like this:

```swift
let allStudents = Array(classes.joined())
```

That will set `allStudents` to an array containing Ash, Brock, Misty, Gloria, Piper, Suzanne, Picard, Riker, and Troi.
