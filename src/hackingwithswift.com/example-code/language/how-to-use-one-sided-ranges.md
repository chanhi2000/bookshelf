<!-- 
One-sided ranges allow us to skip either the start or end of a range to have Swift infer the starting point for us. As an example, consider this array:

```swift
let characters = ["Dr Horrible", "Captain Hammer", "Penny", "Bad Horse", "Moist"]
```

If we wanted to read only the first three items from that array, we could use `characters[..<3]` - we skipped the start point, so Swift will automatically infer the start of the array:

```swift
let bigParts = characters[..<3]
```

That will create an array containing `["Dr Horrible", "Captain Hammer", "Penny"]`.

Similarly, we could skip the end of the range to have Swift infer the end of the array, like this:

```swift
let smallParts = characters[3...]
```

That will create an array containing `["Bad Horse", "Moist"]`.
