Function composition is the ability to combine small functions together to make bigger functions.

In normal circumstances, you’d give some input to function A and get back output, and do the same for function B. When those two functions as combined together, A’s output becomes B’s input, so you provide input to A and get the results back from B.

To demonstrate this, here’s a function that generates random numbers in a specific range:

```swift
func generateRandomNumber(max: Int) -> Int {
    return Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(max)))
}
```

And here’s a function that spells out any number it’s given:

```swift
func spell(number: Int) -> String {
    let formatter = NumberFormatter()
    formatter.numberStyle = .spellOut
    return formatter.string(from: number as NSNumber) ?? ""
}
```

We can define a new operator that lets us combine those two together, like this:

```swift
precedencegroup CompositionPrecedence {
    associativity: left
}

infix operator >>>: CompositionPrecedence

func >>> <T, U, V>(lhs: @escaping (T) -> U, rhs: @escaping (U) -> V) -> (T) -> V {
    return { rhs(lhs($0)) }
}
```

You can learn more about how that works in <a href="/store/pro-swift">Pro Swift</a>.

You can now combine your two smaller functions into bigger ones, like this:

```swift
let spellOutRandom = generateRandomNumber >>> spell
```

`spellOutRandom()` is designed to take the input from the first function (a number) and send back the output from the second function (a string), so we can use it like this:

```swift
print(spellOutRandom(100))
```

That will output a different spelled number each time it’s run.
