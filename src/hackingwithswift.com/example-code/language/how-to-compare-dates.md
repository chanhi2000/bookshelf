<!-- 
Swift’s `Date` struct conforms to both `Equatable` and `Comparable`, which means you check two dates for equality and compare them to see which is earlier.

In practice, this means you can use `<`, `>`, and `==` to compare them just like you would do with strings and integers. Try this in a playground:

```swift
let now = Date.now
let soon = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(5000)

now == soon
now != soon
now < soon
now > soon
```
