<!-- 
Destructuring is the practice of pulling a tuple apart into multiple values in a single assignment. For example, consider a trivial function that accepts names in the format “FirstName LastName” and returns a tuple containing the first and last names separated:

```swift
func splitName(_ name: String) -> (String, String) {
    let parts = name.components(separatedBy: " ")
    return (parts[0], parts[1])
}
```

If you want to call that using destructuring, just use two values for your assignment when calling it, like this:

```swift
let (first, last) = splitName("Taylor Swift")
```

That creates `first` and `last` constants out of the two returned items in the tuple, and you can then use them as normal:

```swift
print(first)
print(last)
```
