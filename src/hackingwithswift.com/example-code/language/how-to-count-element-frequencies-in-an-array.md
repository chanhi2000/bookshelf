<!-- 
If you have an array containing various elements and you want to count how often each item appears, you can do so by combining the `map()` method with a `Dictionary` initializer.

First, create an array of items:

```swift
let items = ["a", "b", "a", "c"]
```

Second, convert that to an array of key-value pairs using tuples, where each value is the number 1:

```swift
let mappedItems = items.map { ($0, 1) }
```

Finally, create a `Dictionary` from that tuple array, asking it to add the 1s together every time it finds a duplicate key:

```swift
let counts = Dictionary(mappedItems, uniquingKeysWith: +)
```

That will create the dictionary `["b": 1, "a": 2, "c": 1]` because dictionaries are not stored in order – as you can see, it tells us that “a” appeared twice, while the other two appeared once.
