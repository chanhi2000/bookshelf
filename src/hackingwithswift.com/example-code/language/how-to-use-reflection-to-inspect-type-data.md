<!-- 
Swift has a built-in `Mirror` struct that lets us query any kind of data in our code. It’s most commonly used to read through the list of properties that are available, but it’s also used in playgrounds to print out user-readable values inside types.

To get started, first create a custom type then an instance of that type:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name = "Taylor Swift"
    var age = 26
}

var taylor = Person()
```

You can now instantiate a `Mirror` object from `taylor`, like this:

```swift
var mirror = Mirror(reflecting: taylor)
```

That mirror isn’t a copy of `taylor`, a *reflection* of it - something you can inspect. For example, you can loop over all the properties inside `taylor` and print out their names and values like this:

```swift
for case let (label?, value) in mirror.children {
    print (label, value)
}
```
