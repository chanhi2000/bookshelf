<!-- 
If you know an instance of `Data` contains a `String` and you want to convert it, you can use the `String(decoding:as:)` initializer, like this:

```swift
let str = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
```

If the `Data` instance can’t be converted to a UTF-8 string, you’ll might be sent back an empty string, but Swift might replace any bad characters with the Unicode replacement character. You do need to know which format is used to store the string, but UTF-8 is usually the best to go with.

If you're unsure about whether the string can safely be converted or not, there's a failable initializer you should use instead:

```swift
if let str = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
    print("Successfully decoded: \(str)")
}
```

Using this optional approach avoids any problems around decoding invalid strings – if it succeeds you can be sure the string that was loaded is intact and correct.
