<!-- 
Arrays have built-in methods for removing the first or last items, but there’s a subtle difference between them.

First, there are two ways of removing the last item: `popLast()` and `removeLast()`. Both remove the last item from the array, but `popLast()` returns an optional - if the array was empty, you get back nil. If you call `removeLast()` on an empty array, your app crashes.

So, in this example `last1` will contain 5 and `last2` will contain 4:

```swift
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let last1 = numbers.popLast()
let last2 = numbers.removeLast()
```

As for removing items from the start of the array, there’s only *one* method: `removeFirst()`. This, like `removeLast()`, will crash your app if called when the array is empty.

So, continuing the above example, this will put 1 into `first1`:

```swift
let first1 = numbers.removeFirst()
```

There is no `popFirst()` because it’s an expensive operation and the developers want you to think twice - each time you remove an item from the front the rest of the items have to move down, so trying to use `popFirst()` in a loop would be inefficient.
