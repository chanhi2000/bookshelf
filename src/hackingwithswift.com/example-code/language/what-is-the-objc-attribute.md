<!-- 
By default Swift generates code that is only available to other Swift code, but if you need to interact with the Objective-C runtime – all of UIKit, for example – you need to tell Swift what to do.

That’s where the `@objc` attribute comes in: when you apply it to a class or method it instructs Swift to make those things available to Objective-C as well as Swift code. So, any time you want to call a method from a `UIBarButtonItem` or a `Timer`, you’ll need to mark that method using `@objc` so it’s exposed – both of those, and many others, are Objective-C code.

Don’t worry: if you *forget* to add `@objc` when it’s needed, your code simply won’t compile – it’s not something you can forget by accident and introduce a bug.

To expose a method to Objective-C, just write `@objc` before its name like this:

```swift
class MyController: UIViewController {
    @objc func authenticateUser() {

    }
}
```

That whole class is automatically Objective-C friendly because it inherits from `UIViewController`, but if you need it you can also explicitly make a class open to Objective-C by marking it `@objc`.
