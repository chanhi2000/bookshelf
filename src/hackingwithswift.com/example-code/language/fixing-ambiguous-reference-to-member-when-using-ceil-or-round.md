<!-- 
If you've ever come across the error message "No 'ceil' candidates produce the expected contextual result type 'Int'" – which can happen with calls to `ceil()`, `floor()`, and `round()` – it's usually down to Swift being unable to satisfy type requirements you have asked for.

Put simply, you might think calling `ceil()` rounds a floating-point number up to its nearest integer, but actually it doesn't return an integer at all: if you give it a `Float` it returns a `Float`, and if you give it a `Double` it returns a `Double`.

So, this code works because `c` ends up being a `Double`:

```swift
let a = 0.5
let c = ceil(a)
```

…whereas this code causes your exact issue because it tries to force a `Double` into an `Int` without a typecast:

```swift
let c: Int = ceil(a)
```

If you need `c` to be an integer, the solution is to convert the return value of `ceil()` to be an integer, like this:

```swift
let c = Int(ceil(a))
```

The same is true of the `floor()` and `round()` functions, so you'd need the same solution.
