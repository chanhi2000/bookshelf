<!-- 
Property observers are Swift's way of letting you attach functionality to changes in property values. For example, you might want to say, "whenever the player's score changes, update this label to show their new score." Here's a basic example that prints message to the debug console when a variable changes:

```swift
var score = 0 {
    willSet {
        print("Score is about to change to \(newValue)")
    }

    didSet {
        print("Score just changed from \(oldValue) to \(score)")
    }
}

score = 10
```
