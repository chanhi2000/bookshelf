<!-- 
Swift gives us two equality operators, `==` and `===`, that do slightly different things. You will almost certainly need to use both of them so it’s worth taking the time to learn them.

First, `==` is the equality operator, which tests that two things are equal for whatever definition of “equal” those things use. For example, `5 == 5` is true because there `==` means an integer comparison, and the same is true for other built-in value types such as strings, booleans, and doubles.

Things get more complicated when `==` is used with a struct you built, because by default they cannot be compared - you need to make them conform to the `Equatable` protocol.

In comparison, `===` is the *identity operator*, which checks whether two instances of a class point to the same memory. This is different from equality, because two objects that were created independently using the same values will be considered equal using `==` but not `===` because they are different objects.

The `===` operator is available only when using classes because structs are designed so they are always uniquely referenced.
