<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
The `Float` data type stores low-precision decimal numbers such as 3.1, 3.14159 and 556.9. It is not used that often in Swift, partly because `Double` is the default for these kinds of numbers (it has a higher precision), and partly because when you come across libraries that use regular floats they are more likely to want `CGFloat` instead.
