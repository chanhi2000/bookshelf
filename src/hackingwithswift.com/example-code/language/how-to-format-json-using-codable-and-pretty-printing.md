<!-- 
When you use `JSONEncoder` and `Codable` to create JSON from your Swift data, it comes out in a compressed format by default – it has all its excess whitespace removed. This makes it efficient for transferring over the network, but hard to debug because it’s just a big jumble of words.

For debugging purposes, it’s a good idea to enable pretty printing for your encoded JSON, which will tell `JSONEncoder` to separate everything using line breaks and spaces so you can read it more easily.

To make this happen, set the `outputFormatting` property of your JSON encoder to be `.prettyPrinted`, like this:

```swift
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.outputFormatting = .prettyPrinted
```
