<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
Consider an array of items containing some optionals, like this one:

```swift
let numbers: [Int?] = [1, nil, 3, nil, 5]
```

If you want to loop over all the items and print them out, you’d write something like this:

```swift
for number in numbers {
    print(number)
}
```

However, that prints out all items in their current state: optionally wrapped integers for some, nil for others. 

With a small change to that loop, you can have Swift unwrap all the optionals then only enter the loop for any that contain a value – any `nil` items are ignored. This is done using `for case let` syntax, like this:

```swift
for case let number? in numbers {
    print(number)
}
```

That will print the numbers 1, 3, and 5.
