I love `CAGradientLayer` because it takes just four lines of code to use, and yet looks great because it quickly and accurately draws smooth color gradients use Core Graphics. Here's a basic example:

```swift
let layer = CAGradientLayer()
layer.frame = CGRect(x: 64, y: 64, width: 160, height: 160)
layer.colors = [UIColor.red.cgColor, UIColor.black.cgColor]
view.layer.addSublayer(layer)
```

Note that you need to fill in an array of `colors` that will be used to draw the gradient. You can provide more than one if you want to, at which point you will also need to fill in the `locations` array to tell `CAGradientLayer` where each color starts and stops. Note that you need to specify your colors as `CGColor` and not `UIColor`.

If you want to make your gradient work in a different direction, you should set the `startPoint` and `endPoint` properties. These are both `CGPoints` where the X and Y values are between 0 and 1, where 0 is one edge and 1 is the opposite edge. The default start point is X 0.5, Y 0.0 and the default end point is X 0.5, Y 1.0, which means both points are in the center of the layer, but it starts at the top and ends at the bottom.

You might be interested to know that `CAGradientLayer` happily works with translucent colors, meaning that you can make a gradient that fades out.
