There are lots of `CALayer` subclasses out there, but `CAShapeLayer` is one of my favorites: it provides hardware-accelerated drawing of all sorts of 2D shapes, and includes extra functionality such as fill and stroke colors, line caps, patterns and more.

To get you started, this uses `UIBezierPath` to create a rounded rectangle, which is then colored red using `CAShaperLayer`. Remember, `CALayer` sits underneath UIKit, so you need to use `CGColor` rather than `UIColor`.

```swift
let layer = CAShapeLayer()
layer.path = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: CGRect(x: 64, y: 64, width: 160, height: 160), cornerRadius: 50).cgPath
layer.fillColor = UIColor.red.cgColor
view.layer.addSublayer(layer)
```
