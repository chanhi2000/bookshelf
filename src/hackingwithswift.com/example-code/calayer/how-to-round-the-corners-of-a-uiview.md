<!-- 
All `UIView` subclasses have the ability to round their corners thanks to their underlying `CALayer` – that's the bit that handles the actual drawing of your views. To round the corners of a view, use this code:

```swift
yourView.layer.cornerRadius = 10
```

The number you specify is how far the rounding should go, measured in points. So if you have a view that's 100x100 points and give it a `cornerRadius` property of 50, it will look like a circle.

Note that some types of view don't have `clipsToBounds` enabled by default, which means their corners will not round until you enable this property.
