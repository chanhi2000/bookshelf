  "title": "How to play custom vibrations using Core Haptics",
  "desc": "Core Haptics lets us define a variety of vibrations and sound effects that trigger with precise timing and behaviors, all powered by the iPhone’s Taptic Engine. These behaviors are somewhat hard to define with words, and are best <em>felt</em> rather than <em>described</em>, but the words Apple uses are things like “intensity” (the relative strength of the vibration) and “sharpness” (whether it’s a dull tap or a more precise one)",
