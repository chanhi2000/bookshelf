<!-- 
All nodes in SpriteKit have a `zPosition` property that dictates its depth on the screen. If you’re using Xcode’s default SpriteKit template then the view you’re rendering into has its `ignoresSiblingOrder` property set to true, which means `zPosition` is the only factor that decides whether one node is drawn above or below another.

All Z positions default to 0, but if you use negative values (-1, -2, etc) it forces those nodes to be drawn behind nodes that have higher Z positions (1, 2, etc). These numbers don’t have any absolute meaning - all that matters is that one number is higher or lower than another. That is, setting a Z position to 10,000 doesn’t make a sprite any larger or more prominent than setting it to 1,000.

Here’s some example code:

```swift
// place the background behind other things
background.zPosition = -1

// place the player in front
player.zPosition = 1

// make the score go above everything
score.zPosition = 10
```
