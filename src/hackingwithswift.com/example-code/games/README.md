{
  "title": "How to create a SpriteKit texture atlas in Xcode",
  "desc": "A SpriteKit texture atlas is actually just a folder with the extension .atlas, but it's more efficient than loading textures individually because multiple images are stored in a single file and thus can be loaded faster. Even better, you don't need to worry about how they are placed or even orientation - you just use them as normal, and SpriteKit does the rest....",
