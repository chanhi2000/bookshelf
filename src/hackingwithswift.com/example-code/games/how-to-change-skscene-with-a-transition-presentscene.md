<!-- 
You can change between SpriteKit scenes by calling the `presentScene()` method on your `SKView`. This can be called either just with a new scene, or with a new scene and a transition animation to use, depending on the effect you want. Here's an example with a transition:

```swift
let scene = NewGameScene(fileNamed: "NewGameScene")!
let transition = SKTransition.moveIn(with: .right, duration: 1)
self.view?.presentScene(scene, transition: transition)
```

There are several beautiful transition types you can try, with the `SKTransition.doorway(withDuration: 1)` transition looking particularly neat.
