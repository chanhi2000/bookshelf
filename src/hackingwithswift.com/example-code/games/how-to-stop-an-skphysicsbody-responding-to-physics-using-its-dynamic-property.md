<!-- 
Enabling physics in SpriteKit is just one line of code, but sometimes you want your physics to be a little more nuanced. For example, your player might have circle physics and should respond to gravity, whereas walls might have rectangle physics and not respond to gravity – they are there to be bounced off, but nothing more.

This problem is solved in SpriteKit by using the `isDynamic` property. It's `true` by default, which means that your objects respond to the world's environment as you would expect, but if you set it to be `false` then you get an object that has active physics but doesn't move as a result of those physics.

Here's an example:

```swift
let wall = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "wall")
wall.position = CGPoint(x: 512, y: 0)
wall.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: wall.size.width / 2.0)
wall.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false
addChild(wall)
```
