<!-- 
One powerful and under-used feature of SpriteKit is its ability to recolor `SKSpriteNodes` dynamically. This has almost zero performance impact, which makes it perfect for having multiple-colored enemies or players. It can also be animated, meaning that you could for example make your player flash white briefly when they've been hit by an enemy.

To tint a sprite cyan, use this code:

```swift
firework.color = UIColor.cyan
firework.colorBlendFactor = 1
```

If you want to animate the sprite coloring, you'd use this:

```swift
let action = SKAction.colorize(with: UIColor.red, colorBlendFactor: 1, duration: 1)
```
