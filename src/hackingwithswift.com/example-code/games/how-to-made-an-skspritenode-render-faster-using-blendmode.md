<!-- 
All SpriteKit nodes have a `blendMode` property that describes how they should be drawn to the screen. The default value is `.alpha`, which means the sprite should be drawn so that its alpha transparency is respected - any parts that are translucent get blended with the existing background color at that point, and any fully transparent parts are not drawn at all.

Alpha drawing is obviously a sensible default, because it allows us to render sprites with irregular shapes and holes. However, if you know for a fact that your sprite is completely rectangular and has no holes then using `.alpha` is wasteful - SpriteKit is forced to do alpha blending even though it isn’t required. This is particularly common with background images: if they are designed to fill the full screen, there’s no need to make them drawing using `.alpha`. 

To fix this - and make such drawing significantly faster - change the blend mode of opaque sprites to be `.replace`, which ignores any alpha in the texture:

```swift
background.blendMode = .replace
```
