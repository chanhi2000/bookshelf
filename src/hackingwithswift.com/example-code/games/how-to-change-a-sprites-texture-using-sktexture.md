<!-- 
Although you can create an `SKSpriteNode` from a color and size, most folks create them from textures – image data stored in an asset catalog or texture atlas. SpriteKit’s textures are handled using their own class called `SKTexture`, and you can load them individually then use them to change the texture used to draw a sprite.

At its most basic, you can change a sprite’s texture like this:

```swift
let texture1 = SKTexture(imageNamed: "newTexture")
someSprite.texture = texture1
```

However, that only works if your sprite and the texture are the same size – if they don’t, the texture will get squashed to fit the available space.

If the sprite and texture are *different* sizes then a better thing to do is use the `setTexture()` action, passing in true for its `resize` parameter like this:

```swift
let texture2 = SKTexture(imageNamed: "newTexture")
let action = SKAction.setTexture(texture2, resize: true)
someSprite.run(action)
```

That will switch the texture over, then grow the sprite to fit the new texture size.
