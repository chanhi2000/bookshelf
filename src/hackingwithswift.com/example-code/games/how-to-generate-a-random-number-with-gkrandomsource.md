<!-- 
GameplayKit is a powerful new framework introduced in iOS 9.0, and one of the (many!) things it does is provide a number of ways to generate random numbers easily. To get started, import the framework into your code like this:

```swift
import GameplayKit
```

You can immediately start generating random numbers just by using this code:

```swift
print(GKRandomSource.sharedRandom().nextInt())
```

That code produces a number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, so if you're happy with negative numbers then you're basically done. Alternatively, if you want a random number between and an upper bound (inclusive!), you should use this code instead:

```swift
print(GKRandomSource.sharedRandom().nextInt(upperBound: 10))
```

That will return a number between 0 and 10, including 0 and 10 themselves.
