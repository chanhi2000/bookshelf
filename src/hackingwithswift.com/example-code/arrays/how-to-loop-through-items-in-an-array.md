<!-- 
Swift offers a selection of ways to loop through an array, but the easiest and fastest is known as fast enumeration and looks like this:

```swift
let array = ["Apples", "Peaches", "Plums"]

for item in array {
    print("Found \(item)")
}
```

That will print "Found Apples", "Found Peaches" then "Found Plums" to the Xcode console. Each time the loop goes around, one item is read from the array and placed into the constant `item` – and note that *is* a constant, so don't try to change it.
