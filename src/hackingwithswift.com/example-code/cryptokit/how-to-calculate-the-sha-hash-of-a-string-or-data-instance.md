<!-- 
iOS 13 introduced a new framework called CryptoKit, which adds important cryptographic functionality such as encryption and hashing.

If you want to calculate the hash value of a string you need to convert it to an instance of `Data` like this:

```swift
let inputString = "Hello, world!"
let inputData = Data(inputString.utf8)
```

You then call the `hash(data:)` method of whichever kind of hash you want: SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512. For example, if you wanted to calculate the SHA-256 hash of your data you’d use this:

```swift
let hashed = SHA256.hash(data: inputData)
```

Finally, you can print out the textual representation of the hash - what we’d considered the user-facing hash string itself - like this:

```swift
print(hashed.description)
```

Obviously if you have an instance of `Data` you want to hash, you can put that directly into `SHA256.hash(data:)`.

If you want to get the *string* of your hash, you should convert using the `String(format:)` initializer, like this:

```swift
let hashString = hashed.compactMap { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
```
