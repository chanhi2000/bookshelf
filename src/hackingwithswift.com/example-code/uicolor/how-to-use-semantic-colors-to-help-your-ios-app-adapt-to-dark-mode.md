<!-- 
When specifying colors for objects in your views, it’s often easier to use the built-in semantic colors of `UIColor` rather than specifying our own custom colors that might not look good in both light and dark mode.

For example, when you are coloring a label, use `UIColor.label`, `.secondaryLabel`, or similar so that UIKit will automatically make sure it stands out.

For backgrounds you should use `UIColor.systemBackground`, `.secondarySystemBackground`, or similar so that when you layer one view over another they don’t appear to become merged.

And when you’re using fixed colors like `.red` or `.blue` you should instead use `.systemRed` or `.systemBlue` to get a color that will adapt to the user’s trait environment – it will be a lighter red when in dark mode, and a darker red in light mode, rather than the fixed pure red of `.red`.
