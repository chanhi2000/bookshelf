  "title": "How to convert a hex color to a UIColor",
  "desc": "Here's a simple extension to <code>UIColor</code> that lets you create colors from hex strings. The new method is a failable initializer, which means it returns nil if you don't specify a color in the correct format. It should be a # symbol, followed by red, green, blue and alpha in hex format, for a total of nine characters. For example, #ffe700ff is gold....",

  "title": "How to convert a HTML name string into a UIColor",
  "desc": "HTML color names let you use familiar titles like 'steel blue' and 'mint cream' rather than hex values, but sadly these standardized names aren't available in iOS - or at least not by default. Fortunately, it's easy to add an extension to <code>UIColor</code> that maps these names to hexadecimal color values, then add another extension to convert hex colors to <code>UIColors</code>. Here's the code:...",
