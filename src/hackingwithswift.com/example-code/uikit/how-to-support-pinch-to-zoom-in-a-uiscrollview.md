<!--
Making a scroll view zoom when you pinch is a multi-step approach, and you need to do all the steps in order for things to work correctly.

First, make sure your scroll view has a maximum zoom scale larger than the default of 1.0. You can change this in Interface Builder if you want, or use the `maximumZoomScale` property in code.

Second, make your view controller the delegate of your scroll view. Again, you can do this in Interface Builder by Ctrl-dragging from the scroll view to your view controller.

Third, make your view controller conform to the `UIScrollViewDelegate` protocol, then add the `viewForZooming(in:)` method, like this:

```swift
func viewForZooming(in scrollView: UIScrollView) -> UIView? {
    return someView
}
```

That's it for code, but make sure you create your layouts consistently – whether you use Auto Layout or not, you need to be careful to [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-apple"/>follow Apple's instructions](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2154/_index.html).
