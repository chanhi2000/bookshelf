<!--
There’s a lot of animation in UIKit, and many users find it either distracting or hard to follow. As a result, iOS has a Reduce Motion accessibility setting that disables many animation and parallax effects, and simplifies most others - at least in their own apps.

If you want to follow suit - and you should - all you need to do is read the property `UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled`. This returns a boolean telling you whether the setting is active or not, so if it’s true you should take steps to animate differently or perhaps not at all.
