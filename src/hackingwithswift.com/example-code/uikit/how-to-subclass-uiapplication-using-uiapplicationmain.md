Subclassing `UIApplication` allows you to override functionality such as opening URLs or changing your icon, but it’s a non-trivial task in Swift because of the `@UIApplicationMain` attribute.

If you look in your <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`AppDelegate.swift` file you’ll see `@UIApplicationMain` appears directly before `class AppDelegate` – this is a special attribute that tells the Swift compiler to generate code to launch your application using default settings.

**You need to delete `@UIApplicationMain` from that file.** We’re going to replace it with custom code.

With that line deleted, create a new Cocoa Touch Class called “MyApplication”, making it subclass from `UIApplication`. We’re going to make our class override the `open()` method so that no part of our application can open URLs outside of <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">https://www.hackingwithswift.com</a>:

```swift
import UIKit

class MyApplication: UIApplication {
    override func open(_ url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenExternalURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:], completionHandler completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil) {
        if let host = url.host, host.contains("hackingwithswift.com") {
            super.open(url, options: options, completionHandler: completion)
        } else {
            completion?(false)
        }
    }
}
```

The third and final step is to create a file called <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift` that is responsible for launching our application. The name is important: it must be exactly <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift`, because that’s the only file that can contain top-level code – i.e., code that isn’t wrapped inside a function, class, struct, or enum.

So, create a new Swift file called <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift`, and give it this code:

```swift
import UIKit

UIApplicationMain(
    CommandLine.argc,
    CommandLine.unsafeArgv, 
    NSStringFromClass(MyApplication.self),
    NSStringFromClass(AppDelegate.self)
)
```

You have now subclassed `UIApplication` and can add any more customizations you need. It should go without saying that dumping code into a `UIApplication` subclass is no better than dumping code into `AppDelegate`.
