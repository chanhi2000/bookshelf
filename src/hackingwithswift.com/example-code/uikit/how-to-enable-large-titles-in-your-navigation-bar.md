<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!--
iOS 11 introduced a new design for navigation bar titles, allowing developers to enable large titles for view controllers that needed to be particularly prominent.

By default these large titles are disabled, but you can enable them with one line of code in your navigation controller’s top view controller:

```swift
navigationController?.navigationBar.prefersLargeTitles = true
```

That will enable large titles for all view controllers that subsequently get pushed, but you can be more selective by adjusting the `navigationItem.largeTitleDisplayMode` property of your view controllers.

For example, if you wanted subsequent view controllers to never use large titles, you would put this into their `viewDidLoad()` method:

```swift
navigationItem.largeTitleDisplayMode = .never
```
