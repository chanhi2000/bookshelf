`UIImageView` is designed to load only local images, but with a little work you can make it load remote images too. To get a basic solution, add an extension to `UIImageView` that downloads image data using a GCD background thread, then converts that to a `UIImage`, and loads it back into the image view on the main thread:

```swift
extension UIImageView {
    func load(url: URL) {
        DispatchQueue.global().async { [weak self] in
            if let data = try? Data(contentsOf: url) {
                if let image = UIImage(data: data) {
                    DispatchQueue.main.async {
                        self?.image = image
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Keep in mind that if you try to call that method several times on the same image view - e.g. if you’re scrolling through a table – then you’re going to hit problems, because multiple images will start downloading.

If you want *that* to work then you should subclass `UIImageView` so you can store the URL that was requested, and compare that URL inside the `load()` function to make sure it hasn’t been changed in the time between starting the fetch and loading the image. But if you’re that serious, I would suggest using something like SDWebImage instead: <a href="https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage">https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage</a>.
