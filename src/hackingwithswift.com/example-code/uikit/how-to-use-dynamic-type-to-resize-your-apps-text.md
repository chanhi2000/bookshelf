Ever since iOS 7.0 users can set a system-wide preferred font size for all apps, but many programmers ignore this setting much to user's annoyance. You're not one of *those* developers, are you? Of course not! So here's how to honor a user's font settings using `UIFont`:

```swift
let headlineFont = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .headline)
let subheadFont = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .subheadline)
```

And that's it! This technology is called Dynamic Type, and it's powerful because that code will return correctly sized fonts for the user's preference, which means your app's text will shrink or grow as needed.

Note that it is technically possible for users to change their Dynamic Type setting while your app is running. If you want to cover this corner case, use `NotificationCenter` to subscribe to the `UIContentSizeCategoryDidChange` notification then refresh your user interface if you receive it.
