If you're working entirely in code, you can register a `UICollectionViewCell` subclass for use with your collection view, so that new cells are dequeued and re-use automatically by the system.

Here's the most basic form of this technique:

```swift
collectionView.register(UICollectionViewCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: "Cell")
```

That registers a basic collection view cell, which you can then customize in code if you want to. You can then dequeue a cell with this:

```swift
func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
    let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath)
    return cell
}
```

If a cell doesn't already exist that can be re-used, a new one will be created automatically.

As you might imagine, you will most of the time want to create your own custom `UICollectionViewCell` subclass and use that instead, but the code is the same - just use your class name instead.

If you're working with Interface Builder, all this work is done for you by creating prototype cells.
