If you wanted to pin a button to the left edge of its parent, you might write code like this:

```swift
button.leftAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.leftAnchor).isActive = true
```

However, that has a problem: in right-to-left languages, the user interface ought to be flipped horizontally for the most part, but your button won’t move - you’ve specifically asked it to be pinned to the left edge regardless of the user’s device settings.

If that’s what you want, you don’t have a problem. However, if you meant “left edge for left-to-right languages and *right* edge for right-to-left languages,” then you should use `leadingAnchor` instead of `leftAnchor`, like this:

```swift
button.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.leadingAnchor).isActive = true
```

For the same effect on the opposite edge, you should use `trailingAnchor` rather than `rightAnchor`. Again, if you specifically want something to appear on the right regardless of language then this does not apply.
