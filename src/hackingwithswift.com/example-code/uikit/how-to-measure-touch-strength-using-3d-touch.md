<!--
You can read a user's 3D Touch strength using the `force` property of a `UITouch`, which is best used when compared against the `touch.maximumPossibleForce`. For example, you can divide one into the other to see how much relative strength is applied, or do a straight comparison to check to see whether the user is pressing as hard as possible.

Before you try to make use of 3D Touch, make sure it's available by checking the `forceTouchCapability` of your current trait collection. Here's an example `touchesMoved()` implementation that checks whether 3D Touch is available and the user is pressing hard:

```swift
override func touchesMoved(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
    super.touchesMoved(touches, with: event)

    if let touch = touches.first {
        if view.traitCollection.forceTouchCapability == .available {
            if touch.force == touch.maximumPossibleForce {
                // user pressed hard - do something!
            }
        }
    }
}
```
