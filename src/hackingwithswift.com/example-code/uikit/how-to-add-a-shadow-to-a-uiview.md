iOS can dynamically generate shadows for any `UIView`, and these shadows automatically adjust to fit the shape of the item in question - even following the curves of text inside a `UILabel`. This functionality is built right in, so all you need to do is configure its properties, and there are four you need to care about:

- `shadowColor` sets the color of the shadow, and needs to be a `CGColor`.
<li>`shadowOpacity` sets how transparent the shadow is, where 0 is invisible and 1 is as strong as possible.
<li>`shadowOffset` sets how far away from the view the shadow should be, to give a 3D offset effect.
<li>`shadowRadius` sets how wide the shadow should be.

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```swift
let yourView = UIView()
yourView.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.black.cgColor
yourView.layer.shadowOpacity = 1
yourView.layer.shadowOffset = .zero
yourView.layer.shadowRadius = 10
```

Be warned: generating shadows dynamically is expensive, because iOS has to draw the shadow around the exact shape of your view's contents. If you can, set the `shadowPath` property to a specific value so that iOS doesn't need to calculate transparency dynamically. For example, this creates a shadow path equivalent to the frame of the view:

```swift
yourView.layer.shadowPath = UIBezierPath(rect: yourView.bounds).cgPath
```

Alternatively, ask iOS to cache the rendered shadow so that it doesn't need to be redrawn:

```swift
yourView.layer.shouldRasterize = true
```

If you want to go down the rasterization route, you should make sure iOS caches the shadow at the same drawing scale as the main screen, otherwise it will look pixelated:

```swift
yourView.layer.rasterizationScale = UIScreen.main.scale
```
