<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!--
All views and subclasses are rendered using the `drawRect()` method, but you should never call that method directly yourself. Instead, it gets called by the system whenever drawing is required, which allows it to to avoid multiple redraws if `drawRect()` is called several times in a row.

Instead, if you want a view to redraw immediately, you should call its `setNeedsDisplay()` method like this:

```swift
myButton.setNeedsDisplay()
```

That will ask UIKit to redraw the button using `drawRect()`, but only if a redraw is not already queued.
