<!--
As soon as you set the `editing` property of a `UITableView` to be true, its cells stop being tappable. This is often a good idea, because if a user explicitly enabled editing mode they probably want to delete or move stuff, and it's only going to be annoying if they can select rows by accident.

Of course, as always, there are times when you specifically want both actions to be available - for the user to be able to move or delete a cell, and also tap on it to select. If that's the situation you find yourself in right now, here's the line of code you need:

```swift
tableView.allowsSelectionDuringEditing = true
```
