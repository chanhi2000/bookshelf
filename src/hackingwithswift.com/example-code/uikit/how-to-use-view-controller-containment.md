View controller containment allows you to embed one view controller inside another, which can simplify and organize your code. It takes four steps:

1. Call `addChild()` on your parent view controller, passing in your child.
2. Set the child’s frame to whatever you need, if you’re using frames.
3. Add the child’s view to your main view, along with any Auto Layout constraints.
4. Call `didMove(toParent:)` on the child, passing in your main view controller.

In Swift code it looks like this:

```swift
addChild(child)
child.view.frame = frame
view.addSubview(child.view)
child.didMove(toParent: self)
```

When you’re finished with it, the steps are conceptually similar but in reverse:

1. Call `willMove(toParent:)`, passing in `nil`.
2. Remove the child view from its parent.
3. Call `removeFromParent()` on the child.

In code, it’s just three lines:

```swift
willMove(toParent: nil)
view.removeFromSuperview()
removeFromParent()
```

Just for convenience you might want to consider adding a small, private extension to `UIViewController` to do these tasks for you – they do need to be run in a precise order, which is easily done incorrectly.

Something like this ought to do it:

```swift
@nonobjc extension UIViewController {
    func add(_ child: UIViewController, frame: CGRect? = nil) {
        addChild(child)

        if let frame = frame {
            child.view.frame = frame
        }

        view.addSubview(child.view)
        child.didMove(toParent: self)
    }

    func remove() {
        willMove(toParent: nil)
        view.removeFromSuperview()
        removeFromParent()
    }
}
```

That’s marked `@nonobjc` so it won’t conflict with any of Apple’s own code, now or in the future.
