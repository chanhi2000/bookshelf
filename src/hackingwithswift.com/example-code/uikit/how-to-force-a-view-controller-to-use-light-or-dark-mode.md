<!--
By default all instances of `UIViewController` are set to automatically adapt their color appearance to match the user’s system preferences, but if you want you can force some or all of your app to use light or dark mode by setting the `overrideUserInterfaceStyle` property of your view controller to `.light` or `.dark`.

For example:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        overrideUserInterfaceStyle = .dark    
    }
}
```

This setting exists on other containers, such as `UIWindow` and `UIView`, and the value of this property cascades to everything inside the thing you change. So, if you set your main `UIWindow` to always have dark mode, then all view controllers and views inside it will always have dark mode.
