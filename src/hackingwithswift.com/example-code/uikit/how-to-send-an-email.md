In the MessageUI framework lies the `MFMailComposeViewController` class, which handles sending emails from your app. You get to set the recipients, message title and message text, but you don't get to send it – that's for the user to tap themselves.

Here's some example code:

```swift
func sendEmail() {
    if MFMailComposeViewController.canSendMail() {
        let mail = MFMailComposeViewController()
        mail.mailComposeDelegate = self
        mail.setToRecipients(["you@yoursite.com"])
        mail.setMessageBody("<p>You're so awesome!</p>", isHTML: true)

        present(mail, animated: true)
    } else {
        // show failure alert
    }
}

func mailComposeController(_ controller: MFMailComposeViewController, didFinishWith result: MFMailComposeResult, error: Error?) {
    controller.dismiss(animated: true)
}
```

Make sure you add `import MessageUI` to any Swift file that uses this code, and you’ll also need to conform to the `MFMailComposeViewControllerDelegate` protocol.

Note that not all users have their device configure to send emails, which is why we need to check the result of `canSendMail()` before trying to send. Note also that you need to catch the `didFinishWith` callback in order to dismiss the mail window.

Warning: this code frequently fails in the iOS Simulator. If you want to test it, try on a real device.
