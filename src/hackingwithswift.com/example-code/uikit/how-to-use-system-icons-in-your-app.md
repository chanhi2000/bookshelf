<!--
iOS 13 lets us use icons from a range of over 1500 designed by Apple, all of which come in a variety of weights and sizes. These icons form part of new `UIImage` API, and they are vector-based so you can us them at a range of sizes without loss of quality.

**Note:** This is a stringly typed API, so you should download the new SF Symbols app that lists all variants - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/">download it here</a>.

To load a system icon you use the new `UIImage(systemName:)` initializer. In its most basic form it looks like this:

```swift
let paperPlane = UIImage(systemName: "paperplane.fill")
let action = UIImage(systemName: "square.and.arrow.down")
```

You can request specific weights of your icon by creating an instance of `UIImage.SymbolConfiguration` like this:

```swift
let boldConfig = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(weight: .bold)
let boldBell = UIImage(systemName: "bell", withConfiguration: boldConfig)
```

More usefully, you can also tell UIKit what kind of text is being rendered nearby so it can ensure the icon is sized appropriately, like this:

```swift
let largeConfig = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(textStyle: .largeTitle)
let largeBolt = UIImage(systemName: "bolt", withConfiguration: largeConfig)
```

This ensures your icons work correctly alongside your other Dynamic Type code.
