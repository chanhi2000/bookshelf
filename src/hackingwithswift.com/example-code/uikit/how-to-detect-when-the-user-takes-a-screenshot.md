<!--
If you’re showing sensitive data it can be important to know when you’re user takes a screenshot. Snapchat, for example, automatically notifies participants in a conversation if someone takes a screenshot, effectively letting them know their privacy might have been breached.

The key is to watch for the `.UIApplicationUserDidTakeScreenshot` message to be posted, which will happen whenever a screenshot happens. For example, this runs a `screenshotTaken()` method:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(screenshotTaken), name: UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification, object: nil)
```

And this just prints a log message instead:

```swift
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(forName: UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification, object: nil, queue: OperationQueue.main) { notification in
    print("Screenshot taken!")
}
```

Use whichever of those two fits your needs best.
