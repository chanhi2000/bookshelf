  "title": "How to find similar words for a search term",
  "desc": "iOS gives us the ability to search for similar words for a term by using <em>word embeddings</em>, which are maps of strings created using machine learning that describe how similar various words are in terms of their meaning. This kind of thing is useful when handling user searches: you might have tagged a photo with “hat”, but your user searched for “sombrero” –&nbsp;word embeddings let us find similar words, and we can then use those variations for data searches.",
