<!-- 
You can loop through every character in a string by treating it as an array. Thanks to Swift's extended support for international languages and emoji, this works great no matter what kind of language you're using.

This code prints out each character one at a time:

```swift
let str = "sunday, monday, happy days"
for char in str {
    print("Found character: \(char)")
}
```
