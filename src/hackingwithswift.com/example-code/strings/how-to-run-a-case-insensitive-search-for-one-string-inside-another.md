<!-- 
You can search for one string inside another using the `range(of:)` method, like this:

```swift
let string = "The rain in Spain"
let range1 = string.range(of: "rain")
```

That returns an optional string index: if the word was found it will say where it was found, otherwise it will be nil.

However, `range(of:)` does a *case-sensitive* search by default, which means it will match “rain” but not “Rain” or “RAIN”. If you want a case-insensitive search you need to provide an extra parameter called `options`, passing it `.caseInsensitive`:

```swift
let range2 = string.range(of: "rain", options: .caseInsensitive)
```

That returns the same optional value depending on what was found, so you can wrap the whole thing in an `if let` to see whether a match was found:

```swift
if let range3 = string.range(of: "rain", options: .caseInsensitive) {
    // match
} else {
    // no match
}
```
