<!-- 
Raw strings place hash signs - `#` - before and after their quote mark, and modify the way Swift handles strings in two ways.

First, a string that starts with `#"` must *end* with a `"#`, which means any quote marks inside the string are ignored:

```swift
let string1 = #"The rain in "Spain" falls mainly on the Spaniards"#
```

Second, any escape sequences - things that start with `\` - now have their regular meaning. So, this will print one line of text:

```swift
let string2 = #"The rain\nin Spain\nfalls mainly\non the Spaniards"#
```

With a regular Swift string the instances of `\n` would have been interpreted as line breaks.

If you want to use escape characters, for example if you want to use string interpolation, you must use `\#(yourValue)`, like this:

```swift
let name = "Duane Dibbley"
print(#"Hello! My name is \#(name)."#)
```
