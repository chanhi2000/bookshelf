ROT13 is a simple algorithm that shifts letters in a string forward 13 places. It’s obviously not suitable for any serious encryption, but it’s very useful for hiding text so its meaning is not obvious - posting spoilers on a forum, for example, is best done using ROT13 to avoid someone getting annoyed.

It’s not hard to write a `rot13()` function, but it *is* a little harder to wrap it up neatly so you avoid global variables while still making it easy to use. Because you can’t add stored variables to an extension on `String`, the cleanest thing to do is create a new `ROT13` type that can store the transformation from regular letters to ROT13, then run the calculation.

In code, it looks like this:

```swift
struct ROT13 {
    // create a dictionary that will store our character mapping
    private static var key = [Character: Character]()

    // create arrays of all uppercase and lowercase letters
    private static let uppercase = Array("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
    private static let lowercase = Array("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")

    static func string(_ string: String) -> String {
        // if this is the first time the method is being called, calculate the ROT13 key dictionary
        if ROT13.key.isEmpty {
            for i in 0 ..< 26 {
                ROT13.key[ROT13.uppercase[i]] = ROT13.uppercase[(i + 13) % 26]
                ROT13.key[ROT13.lowercase[i]] = ROT13.lowercase[(i + 13) % 26]
            }
        }

        // now return the transformed string
        let transformed = string.map { ROT13.key[$0] ?? $0 }
        return String(transformed)
    }
}
```

I’ve used private properties there because there’s no reason these implementation details should leak out, and it’s all static because there’s no need to create new `ROT13` instances every time we need to run the conversion.

With that in place we can write an extension on `String` to calculate the ROT13 using our struct:

```swift
extension String {
    func rot13() -> String {
        return ROT13.string(self)
    }
}
```

That extension can now be called on a regular string, so users don’t need to care about how we implemented ROT13:

```swift
print("Hello, world!".rot13())
```
