<!-- 
If you have an important text file built into your app bundle that want to load it at runtime fact, `String` has an initializer just for this purpose. It’s called `contentsOfFile`, and here it is in action:

```swift
if let filepath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "example", ofType: "txt") {
    do {
        let contents = try String(contentsOfFile: filepath)
        print(contents)
    } catch {
        // contents could not be loaded
    }
} else {
    // example.txt not found!
}
```

That code loads a file called **example.txt** into a string called `contents`.
