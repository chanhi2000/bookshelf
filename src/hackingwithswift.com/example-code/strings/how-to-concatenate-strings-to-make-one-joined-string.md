<!-- 
Swift offers three different ways of joining strings. The first is using the `+` operator to join two strings to make a third:

```swift
let string1 = "Hello, "
let string2 = "world"
let combined1 = string1 + string2
```

The second is user string interpolation to make a new string”

```swift
let combined2 = "\(string1) \(string2)"
```

The last is using the `+=` operator to add and assign a string to an existing string:

```swift
var combined3 = "Goodbye, "
combined3 += "cruel world"
```
