<!-- 
Swift strings have a built-in initializer that lets you create strings by repeating a string a certain number of times. To use it, just provide the string to repeat and a count as its two parameters, like this:

```swift
let str = String(repeating: "a", count: 5)
```

That will set `str` to “aaaaa”.
