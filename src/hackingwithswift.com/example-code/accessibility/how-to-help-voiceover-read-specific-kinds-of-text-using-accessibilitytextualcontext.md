<!-- 
Although VoiceOver does a great job of reading our interfaces by default, sometimes it can benefit from a little extra guidance in order to read content appropriately. `accessibilityTextualContext` is a property available on all UIKit controls that lets us mark content as being a specific type – output from the command line, some spreadsheet data, or even narrative speech.

For example, we could mark a label as containing source code like this:

```swift
yourLabel.accessibilityTextualContext = .sourceCode
```

Now that VoiceOver knows the label contains source code, it could choose to read out every character of punctuation rather than assume that “,” and “.” are just part of a sentence.
