<!-- 
PDFKit comes with a built-in class called `PDFDocument`, which allows us to load and parse PDF documents. It’s used when you want to put your PDF into a `PDFView`, but it’s also useful when you just want to read text from the PDF: you can loop over each page in the PDF, read its `attributedString` property, then append it to an attributed string containing all the text from the PDF.

First, add `import PDFKit` in the Swift file you’re using, then add the following example code to read out the text contents of a file:

```swift
if let pdf = PDFDocument(url: yourDocumentURL) {
    let pageCount = pdf.pageCount
    let documentContent = NSMutableAttributedString()

    for i in 0 ..< pageCount {
        guard let page = pdf.page(at: i) else { continue }
        guard let pageContent = page.attributedString else { continue }
        documentContent.append(pageContent)
    }
}
```

It’s an *attributed* string, so it will retain formatting from the PDF as best as it can.
