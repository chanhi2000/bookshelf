<!-- 
iOS has a built-in speech transcription system, which allows you to convert any audio recording into a text stream. It takes a few steps to configure, so let’s walk through them.

First, add `import Speech` to the top of your Swift file, to bring in the Speech framework.

Second, request permission to transcribe audio:

```swift
func requestTranscribePermissions() {
    SFSpeechRecognizer.requestAuthorization { [unowned self] authStatus in
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            if authStatus == .authorized {
                print("Good to go!")
            } else {
                print("Transcription permission was declined.")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Third, add a key to your Info.plist called `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`, then give it a string describing what you intend to do with the transcriptions.

Finally, write a method to perform transcription on an audio URL. This URL should be a recording you’ve already made, that is stored locally on the device:

```swift
func transcribeAudio(url: URL) {
    // create a new recognizer and point it at our audio
    let recognizer = SFSpeechRecognizer()
    let request = SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest(url: url)

    // start recognition!
    recognizer?.recognitionTask(with: request) { [unowned self] (result, error) in
        // abort if we didn't get any transcription back
        guard let result = result else {
            print("There was an error: \(error!)")
            return
        }

        // if we got the final transcription back, print it
        if result.isFinal {
            // pull out the best transcription...
            print(result.bestTranscription.formattedString)
        }
    }
}
```

Note: the `isFinal` property is there because you may get an initial transcription back containing some or all of the text, but it’s only considered final – i.e. as good as it gets – when the `isFinal` flag is true.
