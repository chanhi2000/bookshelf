<!-- 
The `UIWebView` class has been around since iOS 2.0 as a way to show HTML content inside your app, but iOS 8.0 introduced `WKWebView` as an alternative - what's the difference?

Well, there are several differences, but two are particularly important. First, `UIWebView` is part of UIKit, and thus is available to your apps as standard. You don't need to import anything - it's just there. This also means it's available inside Interface Builder, so you can drag and drop web view into your designs.

Second, `WKWebView` is run in a separate process to your app so that it can draw on native Safari JavaScript optimizations. This means `WKWebView` loads web pages faster and more efficiently than `UIWebView`, and also doesn't have as much memory overhead for you.

In iOS 8.0 `WKWebView` was unable to load local files, but this got fixed in iOS 9.0. The main reason to use `UIWebView` nowadays is for access to older features such as "Scale pages to fit" - this is not available in `WKWebView`.
