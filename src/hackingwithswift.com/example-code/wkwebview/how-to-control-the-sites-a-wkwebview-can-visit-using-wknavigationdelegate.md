By default a `WKWebView` can navigate to any links the user selects, but it’s common to want to restrict that. It only takes three steps to accomplish this:

1. Make your view controller conform to `WKNavigationDelegate`.
<li>Assign your view controller to be your web view’s `navigationDelegate`.
<li>Implement the `decidePolicyFor` method to decide whether each URL should be allowed or denied.

Let’s try it out now. First, make your view controller conform to `WKNavigationDelegate`.

Second, set your view controller to be the `navigationDelegate` property of your web view. This might be done in `viewDidLoad()`, but you can also change the delegate dynamically. Either way, you need to use this code:

```swift
yourWebView.navigationDelegate = self
```

Finally, implement the `decidePolicyFor` method. This is the only part that takes any work: you need to pull out the host of the URL that was requested, run any checks you want to make sure it’s OK, then call the `decisionHandler()` closure with either `.allow` to allow the URL or `.cancel` to deny access.

Here’s an example to get you started:

```swift
func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, decidePolicyFor navigationAction: WKNavigationAction, decisionHandler: @escaping (WKNavigationActionPolicy) -> Void) {
    if let host = navigationAction.request.url?.host {
        if host.contains("hackingwithswift.com") {
            decisionHandler(.allow)
            return
        }
    }

    decisionHandler(.cancel)
}
```

That code will allow navigation only to URLs that contain “hackingwithswift.com”.
