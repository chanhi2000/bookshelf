<!-- 
One of the many advantages of `WKWebView` over `UIWebView` is its ability to draw on some of the native user interface of Safari. It's a long way from the `SFSafariViewController` that was introduced in iOS 9.0, but you can enable the built-in gestures that let users go back and forward by swiping left and right.

Here's the code:

```swift
webView.allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures = true
```
