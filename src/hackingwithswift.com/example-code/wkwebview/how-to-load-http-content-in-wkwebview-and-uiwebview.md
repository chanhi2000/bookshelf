<!-- 
App Transport Security (ATS) normally doesn’t allow our apps to connect to HTTP servers, but there’s a special exception you can add to allow `UIWebView` and `WKWebView` to load insecure content.

Like all all ATS settings, this is configured inside your application's Info.plist file, and this is one of the very few times when editing your plist as source code is faster than trying to use the GUI editor in Xcode. So, right-click on your Info.plist and choose Open As > Source Code.

Your plist should end like this:

```swift
</dict>
</plist>
```

Just before that, I'd like you to paste this:

```swift
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

That tells ATS to allow Apple’s web views to access any content, secure or otherwise.
