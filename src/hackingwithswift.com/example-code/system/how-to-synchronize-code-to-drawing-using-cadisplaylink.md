<!-- 
Lots of beginners think `Timer` is a great way to handle running apps or games so that update code is executed every time the screen is redrawn. Their logic is simple: update the app every 60th of a second and you're perfectly placed for smooth redraws.

The problem is, they are forgetting that `Timer` doesn't offer precise firing and can drift earlier or later than requested updates, and also has no idea about screen redraws and so could happily fire 10ms after a screen redraw just happened - and when you're working to 16.666ms frames, 10ms is a long time!

A smarter and faster solution is the `CADisplayLink` class, which automatically calls a method you define as soon as a screen redraw happens, so you always have maximum time to execute your update code. It's extremely simple to use - here's an example to get you started:

```swift
let displayLink = CADisplayLink(target: self, selector: #selector(update))
displayLink.add(to: .current, forMode: .common)
```

That will call a method called `update()` every 60th of a second by default. You can see it in action with this method stub:

```swift
@objc func update() {
    print("Updating!")
}
```
