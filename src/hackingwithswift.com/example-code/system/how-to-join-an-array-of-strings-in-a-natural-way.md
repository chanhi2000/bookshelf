<!-- 
Swift provides the `ListFormatter` class as a built-in way of joining lists of strings into a single string so that the last item has “and” before it, like a natural English string. So, rather than just getting “A, B, C” you actually get “A, B and C” - it’s much more suitable for user interfaces.

Here’s some example code:

```swift
let names = ["Ash", "Brock", "Misty"]
let joined1 = ListFormatter.localizedString(byJoining: names)
print(joined1)
```

That will print “Ash, Brock and Misty”. (No, there’s no way of asking it for the Oxford comma, so “Ash, Brock, and Misty” isn’t possible.)

If you want to join the strings without using the “and” at the end, you should just use the `joined(separator:)` method, like this:

```swift
let joined2 = names.joined(separator: ", ")
print(joined2)
```

That will print “Ash, Brock, Misty”.
