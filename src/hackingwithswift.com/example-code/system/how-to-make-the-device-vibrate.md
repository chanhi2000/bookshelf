<!-- 
All iPhones have a built-in motor to create vibration effects, and if you just want a quick vibration it takes just one line of code:

```swift
AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate)
```

You’ll need to import the AVFoundation framework if you don’t have it already.

That’s not a particularly easy line of code to remember, so why not make it an extension on `UIDevice`?

```swift
extension UIDevice {
    static func vibrate() {
        AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate)
    }
}
```

Now you can just call `UIDevice.vibrate()` as needed.
