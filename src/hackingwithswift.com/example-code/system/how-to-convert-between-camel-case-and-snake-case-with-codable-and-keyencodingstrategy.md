<!-- 
Most Swift developers use camel case for naming properties, which means we start with a lowercase letter then capitalize the first letter of second and subsequent words: `numberOfUsers` or `powerLevel`. On the other hand, many web APIs prefer snake case, written as `number_of_users` and `power_level`, so if you need to convert camel case to snake case you need to use the `keyEncodingStrategy` of `JSONEncoder`, like this:

```swift
let encoder = JSONEncoder()
encoder.keyEncodingStrategy = .convertToSnakeCase

if let encoded = try? encoder.encode(yourData) {
    // continue with encoded data
}
```

With that set, Swift can convert property names as part of the encoding process, which makes `Codable` much easier to use.
