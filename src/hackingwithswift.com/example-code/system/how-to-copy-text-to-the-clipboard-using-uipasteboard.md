<!-- 
You can write to and read from the iOS clipboard by using the `UIPasteboard` class, which has a `general` property that returns the shared system space for copying and pasting data between apps. Using this you can write text to the clipboard just like this:

```swift
let pasteboard = UIPasteboard.general
pasteboard.string = "Hello, world!"
```

To read text back from the clipboard, you should unwrap its optional value like this:

```swift
if let string = pasteboard.string {
    // text was found and placed in the "string" constant
}
```
