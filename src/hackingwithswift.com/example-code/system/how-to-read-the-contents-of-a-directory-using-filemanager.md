<!-- 
If you want to work with files `FileManager` almost certainly has the answer, and it's no different in this case: it has a method called `contentsOfDirectory(atPath:)` that lists all the files in a specific directory. For example, we could have it list all the files in our app's resource directory like this:

```swift
let fm = FileManager.default
let path = Bundle.main.resourcePath!

do {
    let items = try fm.contentsOfDirectory(atPath: path)

    for item in items {
        print("Found \(item)")
    }
} catch {
    // failed to read directory – bad permissions, perhaps?
}
```

In this particular case the `try` should never fail, but you should still have the `catch` block in there just in case.
