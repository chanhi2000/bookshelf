<!-- 
You can use `perform(_:with:afterDelay:)` to run a method after a certain number of seconds have passed, but if you want to run code at a specific time – say at exactly 4pm – then you should use `Timer` instead. This class is great for executing code repeatedly at a specific time interval, but it's also great for running code at an exact time that you specify.

This is accomplished using a `Timer` constructor that accepts an `Date` for when the timer should fire. You can make this date however you want, which is what makes this approach so flexible.

As a simple example, this will create a timer that calls a `runCode()` method in five seconds:

```swift
let date = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(5)
let timer = Timer(fireAt: date, interval: 0, target: self, selector: #selector(runCode), userInfo: nil, repeats: false)
RunLoop.main.add(timer, forMode: .common)
```

Notice how you can specify a `interval` parameter? That's for when you set `repeats` to be `true`. If you have a `Date` 5 seconds from now and an `interval` of 1 (after setting `repeat` to be true!), it means "call `runCode()` after five seconds, then every one second after that."
