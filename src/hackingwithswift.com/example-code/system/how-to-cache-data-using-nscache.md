<!-- 
Here's an easy win for you that will make your apps immediately much better: `NSCache` is a specialized class that behaves similarly to a mutable dictionary with one major difference: iOS will automatically remove objects from the cache if the device is running low on memory.

Helpfully, if the system does encounter memory pressure `NSCache` will automatically start to remove items without you knowing about it, which means you won't get a memory warning unless even more RAM needs to be cleared. It will also remove items intelligently, trying to keep as much cached as possible.

Here's how to use it, imagining a fictional class called `ExpensiveObjectClass` that you want to compute as infrequently as you can:

```swift
let cache = NSCache<NSString, ExpensiveObjectClass>()
let myObject: ExpensiveObjectClass

if let cachedVersion = cache.object(forKey: "CachedObject") {
    // use the cached version
    myObject = cachedVersion
} else {
    // create it from scratch then store in the cache
    myObject = ExpensiveObjectClass()
    cache.setObject(myObject, forKey: "CachedObject")
}
```
