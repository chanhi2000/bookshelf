If you want the user to exit your app and show a website in Safari, it's just one line of code in Swift. I'll make it three here because I'll create the URL in the code too, then safely unwrap it:

```swift
if let url = URL(string: "https://www.hackingwithswift.com") {
    UIApplication.shared.open(url)
}
```

It's worth adding that you have the option of using `SFSafariViewController` inside your app, which recreates the entire Safari experience right inside your app. See <a href="/read/32/overview">Hacking with Swift project 32</a> for a tutorial on how to do this.
