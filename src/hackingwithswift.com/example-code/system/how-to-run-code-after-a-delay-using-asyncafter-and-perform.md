<!-- 
There are two ways to run code after a delay using Swift: GCD and `perform(_:with:afterDelay:)`, but GCD has the advantage that it can run arbitrary blocks of code, whereas the `perform()` method runs methods.

So, using GCD we can write something that runs code after a half-second delay:

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) {
    // your code here
}
```

An alternative option is to use `perform(_:with:afterDelay:)`, which lets you specify a method to call after a certain time has elapsed.

To call the `authenticate()` method after 1 second, you would use this code:

```swift
perform(#selector(authenticate), with: nil, afterDelay: 1)
```

Note: any method called using `perform(_:with:afterDelay:)` must be marked with the `@objc` attribute.
