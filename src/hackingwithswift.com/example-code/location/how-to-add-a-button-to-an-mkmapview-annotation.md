The built-in `MKPinAnnotationView` annotation view has a `rightCalloutAccessoryView` property that can be set to any kind of `UIView`, including buttons. The button doesn't need to have an action attached to it, because there's a separate method that gets called when it's tapped.

First up, here's how you'd create a button inside an annotation view:

```swift
let btn = UIButton(type: .detailDisclosure)
annotationView.rightCalloutAccessoryView = btn
```

For context, here's a complete implementation of `viewForAnnotation` that uses a button. This is taken from <a href="/read/19/overview">project 19</a> of Hacking with Swift, where I created a class called `Capital` that implemented the `MKAnnotation` protocol – you'll need to adjust this for your own annotation type:

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, viewFor annotation: MKAnnotation) -> MKAnnotationView? {
    let identifier = "Capital"

    if annotation is Capital {
        if let annotationView = mapView.dequeueReusableAnnotationView(withIdentifier: identifier) {
            annotationView.annotation = annotation
            return annotationView
        } else {
            let annotationView = MKPinAnnotationView(annotation:annotation, reuseIdentifier:identifier)
            annotationView.isEnabled = true
            annotationView.canShowCallout = true

            let btn = UIButton(type: .detailDisclosure)
            annotationView.rightCalloutAccessoryView = btn
            return annotationView
        }
    }

    return nil
}
```

When it comes to detecting taps on your button, implement the `calloutAccessoryControlTapped` method. This tells you the annotation view that was tapped (from which you can pull out the annotation), the control that was tapped (in our case it's a button), and also the map view the whole thing belongs to. Here's an example:

```swift
func mapView(_ mapView: MKMapView, annotationView view: MKAnnotationView, calloutAccessoryControlTapped control: UIControl) {
    let capital = view.annotation as! Capital
    let placeName = capital.title
    let placeInfo = capital.info

    let ac = UIAlertController(title: placeName, message: placeInfo, preferredStyle: .alert)
    ac.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .default))
    present(ac, animated: true)
}
```
