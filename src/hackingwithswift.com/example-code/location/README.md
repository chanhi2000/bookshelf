  "title": "How to add a button to an MKMapView annotation",
  "desc": "The built-in <code>MKPinAnnotationView</code> annotation view has a <code>rightCalloutAccessoryView</code> property that can be set to any kind of <code>UIView</code>, including buttons. The button doesn't need to have an action attached to it, because there's a separate method that gets called when it's tapped",

  "title": "How to add an MKMapView using MapKit",

{
  "title": "How to detect iBeacons",
  "desc": "Detecting iBeacons requires a number of steps, but before we can start writing any code we first need to add some privacy descriptions to your Info.plist file.

  "title": "How to find directions using MKMapView and MKDirections.Request",
  "desc": "MapKit is great for letting users navigate from place to place, but also makes it easy for you to plot directions from one place to another. You just tell iOS where you're starting from, where you're going, as well as how you're traveling (by car, foot, or mass transit), and it will find routes for you",

Calling this method returns immediately (meaning that your code carries on executing) but when iOS has managed (or failed) to get a fix on the user's location you will be told.
