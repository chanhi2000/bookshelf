You can add places to any map view using the `MKPlacemark` class, and it’s different from adding regular annotations – the map view shows the whole address on the map, even from far away, so users can see important points easily.

Your address needs to be specified as a series of keys from the Contacts framework, so start by adding this import:

```swift
import Contacts
```

Now add the GPS coordinate and address for the placemark you want. This creates a coordinate and address for Fortnum & Mason in London:

```swift
let coords = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(51.5083, -0.1384)

let address = [CNPostalAddressStreetKey: "181 Piccadilly, St. James's", CNPostalAddressCityKey: "London", CNPostalAddressPostalCodeKey: "W1A 1ER", CNPostalAddressISOCountryCodeKey: "GB"]
```

You can then wrap that up inside an `MKPlacemark` instance like this:

```swift
let place = MKPlacemark(coordinate: coords, addressDictionary: address)
```

Finally, add that to your map view. `MKPlacemark` conforms to the `MKAnnotation` protocol, so you use `addAnnotation()`:

```swift
mapView.addAnnotation(place)
```
