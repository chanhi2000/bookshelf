<!-- 
If you use `URLSession` to make a data task while the user has no internet connection, your request will fail immediately and report an error. However, if you create your session with the `waitsForConnectivity` configuration option set to true, then the system will automatically wait some time to see if connectivity becomes available before trying the request.

For example, this creates a data task that fetches a URL only when internet connectivity is available:

```swift
let config = URLSessionConfiguration.default
config.waitsForConnectivity = true

URLSession(configuration: config).dataTask(with: yourURL) { data, response, error in
    if let error = error {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    } ei

    // use your data here
}.resume()
```

By default, the system will wait seven days to see if internet connectivity becomes available, but you can control that with the `timeoutIntervalForResource` property on your configuration. For example, this will ask the system to wait 60 seconds:

```swift
config.timeoutIntervalForResource = 60
```
