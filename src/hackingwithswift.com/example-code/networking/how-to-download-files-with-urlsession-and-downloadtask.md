<!-- 
`URLSession` is designed to make network transfers as easy as possible, and a great example of that is its `downloadTask`()` method. This fetches the contents of a URL you specify, saves it to a local file, then calls a completion handler so you can manipulate the file - all in one.

To demonstrate this, here’s some code to download the source code to the apple.com homepage:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://www.apple.com")!

let task = URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url) { localURL, urlResponse, error in
    if let localURL = localURL {
        if let string = try? String(contentsOf: localURL) {
            print(string)
        }
    }
}

task.resume()
```

There are a few important things to note in there:

1. Your completion handler gets called with a local URL, which is where the data was saved locally. This is optional, so you need to unwrap it carefully.
<li>If something went wrong - e.g. if the network was down - then you’ll get an error passed to you explaining what happened.
<li>When you have created your download task you should call `resume()` on it to make it happen.
<li>You don’t need to worry about storing the download task somewhere while it happens - it’s being tracked by the shared `URLSession` on your behalf.
