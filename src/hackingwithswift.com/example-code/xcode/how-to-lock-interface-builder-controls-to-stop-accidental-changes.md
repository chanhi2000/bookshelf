<!-- 
Interface Builder is the standard tool for making iOS interfaces using drag and drop, but it does make it remarkably easy to make a mistake – moving a view by accident, adjusting a property with a typo, or perhaps embedding one view inside another by dragging.

Fortunately, there’s a quick and easy fix: you can select any control then lock it so that no more changes can happen. To try it out, select something (e.g. a button), then go to the Class inspector and look for the Lock property. It’s set to “Inherited – (Nothing)” by default, but you can change it to “All Properties” to ensure that it can’t be moved or have any of its settings adjusted.
