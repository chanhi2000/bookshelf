<!-- 
Swift Package Manager is a tool that generates Swift projects then manages dependencies for them, and it’s commonly used if want to build your projects without Xcode. If you have Xcode installed then you already have the Swift Package Manager, but if you’re using Linux it will come with the Swift for Linux package from <a href="https://swift.org/">https://swift.org/</a>.

You can create a new project using just one command, although make sure you run it in an empty directory because it creates files:

```swift
swift package init --type=executable
```

That will generate <FontIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`Sources/YourProject/`<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift` for your code, plus <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`Package.swift` for dependencies, and more. Run `swift build` to build your source code, then `swift run` to execute it.
