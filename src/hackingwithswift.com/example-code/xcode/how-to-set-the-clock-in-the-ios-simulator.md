<!-- 
By default the iOS Simulator shows whatever the time is on your Mac, but you can use Xcode’s `simctl` command to override that with a custom time.

For example, Apple always uses 9:41am in their screenshots, because that was the time the original iPhone was announced. If you want to get the same thing in your simulator screenshots, use this command: 

**xcrun simctl status_bar "iPhone 12 Pro Max" override --time "9:41"**

You should replace the simulator name with whatever device you want to change.

**Tip:** The time shown is just a string, and can be whatever you want. You could use **--time “twostraws”** for example, and that would work just fine.

For much more control over how your simulator looks and works, check out my free <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/ControlRoom">Control Room</a> app on GitHub.
