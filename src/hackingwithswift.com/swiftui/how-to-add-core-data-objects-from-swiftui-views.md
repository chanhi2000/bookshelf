Saving Core Data objects in SwiftUI works in exactly the same way it works outside of SwiftUI: get access to the managed object context, create an instance of your type inside that context, then save the context when you’re ready.

If you followed my [Core Data and SwiftUI set up instructions](/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-configure-core-data-to-work-with-swiftui.md), you’ve already injected your managed object context into the SwiftUI environment.

Anywhere you need to create Core Data objects you should add an `@Environment` property to `ContentView` to read the managed object context right out:

```swift
@Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var managedObjectContext
```

Next, go ahead and create an instance of your Core Data entity class wherever you need, referencing that `managedObjectContext`. In my example setup, we have a ProgrammingLanguage entity with `name` and `creator` properties, so we could create one of those inside a SwiftUI button action like this:

```swift
Button("Insert example language") {
    let language = ProgrammingLanguage(context: managedObjectContext)
    language.name = "Python"
    language.creator = "Guido van Rossum"
    // more code here
}
```

Finally, save the context whenever is appropriate - that might be immediately, after a group of objects have been added, when the state of your app changes, and so on. 

If you’re using my `PersistenceController` setup code from earlier, replace `// more code here` with this:

```swift
PersistenceController.shared.save()
```

If you’re not, use this code instead:

```swift
do {
    try managedObjectContext.save()
} catch {
    // handle the Core Data error
}
```

Remember, for general saves that don’t directly follow creating a new object, it’s usually worth adding a check to see whether your managed object context has any changes:

```swift
if managedObjectContext.hasChanges {
```
