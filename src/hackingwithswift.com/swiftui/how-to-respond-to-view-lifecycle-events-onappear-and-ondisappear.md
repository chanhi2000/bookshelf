SwiftUI gives us equivalents to UIKit's `viewDidAppear()` and `viewDidDisappear()` in the form of `onAppear()` and `onDisappear()`. You can attach any code to these two events that you want, and SwiftUI will execute them when they occur.

As an example, this creates two views that use `onAppear()` and `onDisappear()` to print messages, with a navigation link to move between the two:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack {
                NavigationLink {
                    DetailView()
                } label: {
                    Text("Hello World")
                }
            }
            .onAppear {
                print("ContentView appeared!")
            }
            .onDisappear {
                print("ContentView disappeared!")
            }
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Second View")
        }
        .onAppear {
            print("DetailView appeared!")
        }
        .onDisappear {
            print("DetailView disappeared!")
        }
    }
}
```

When that code runs you should be able to move between the two views and see messages printed in your Xcode debug console.
