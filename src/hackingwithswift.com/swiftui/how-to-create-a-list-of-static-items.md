> Updated for Xcode 15

To create a static list of items you first need to define what each row in your list should look like. This is a view just like any other, and can have any parameters for data you intend to show in the row. Once you have your row, you can create a `List` view that creates as many rows as you need.

For example, this code defines a `Pizzeria` view that will show a `name` string, then uses that as a row for a `List` with three fixed pieces of data:

```swift
struct Pizzeria: View {
    let name: String

    var body: some View {
        Text("Restaurant: \(name)")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Pizzeria(name: "Joe's Original")
            Pizzeria(name: "The Real Joe's Original")
            Pizzeria(name: "Original Joe's")
        }
    }
}
```

![A list containing “Restaurant: Joe's Original”, “Restaurant: The Real Joe's Original”, and “Restaurant: Original Joe's”.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-create-a-list-of-static-items-1~dark@2x.png)

When that code runs you'll see three rows in a table, just like you would have had with `UITableView` in UIKit or `NSTableView` in AppKit.

You don't need to make each row use the same view type, so you can mix and match row views as you need.
