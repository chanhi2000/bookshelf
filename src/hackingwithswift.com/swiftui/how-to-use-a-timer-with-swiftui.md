> Updated for Xcode 15

If you want to run some code regularly, perhaps to make a countdown timer or similar, you should use `Timer` and the `onReceive()` modifier.

For example, this code creates a timer publisher that fires every second, updating a label with the current time:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var currentDate = Date.now
    let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()

    var body: some View {
        Text("\(currentDate)")
            .onReceive(timer) { input in
                currentDate = input
            }
    }
}
```

It's important to use `.main` for the runloop option, because our timer will update the user interface. As for the `.common` mode, that allows the timer to run alongside other common events – for example, if the text was in a scroll view that was moving.

As you can see, the `onReceive()` closure gets passed in some input containing the current date. In the code above we assign that straight to `currentDate`, but you could use it to calculate how much time has passed since a previous date.

If you specifically wanted to create a countdown timer or stopwatch, you should create some state to track how much time remains, then subtract from that when the timer fires. 

For example, we could create a countdown timer that shows time remaining in a label, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var timeRemaining = 10
    let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()

    var body: some View {
        Text("\(timeRemaining)")
            .onReceive(timer) { _ in
                if timeRemaining > 0 {
                    timeRemaining -= 1
                }
            }
    }
}
```
