SwiftUI’s views should be structs, which means they are immutable by default. If this were our own code we could mark methods using `mutating` to tell Swift they will change values, but we can’t do that in SwiftUI because it uses a computed property.

If you want to change a property’s value while your program runs, you should mark it using `@State`, like this:

```swift
@State private var runCount = 0
```

For more complex properties, such as reference types or values that are shared across multiple views, you should use `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject` or `@EnvironmentObject` instead.
