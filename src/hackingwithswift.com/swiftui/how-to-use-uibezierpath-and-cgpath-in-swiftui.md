If you have existing paths made using `UIBezierPath` or `CGPath` it’s trivial to convert them for use in SwiftUI because the `Path` struct has an initializer directly from `CGPath`.

::: note

`UIBezierPath` is not available in macOS, so if you’re trying to keep your SwiftUI code cross platform you should migrate to `CGPath` instead.

:::

As an example, here’s a `UIBezierPath` extension I made to store the logo for an app I built, called Unwrap:

```swift
extension UIBezierPath {
    /// The Unwrap logo as a Bezier path.
    static var logo: UIBezierPath {
        let path = UIBezierPath()
        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: 0.534, y: 0.5816))
        path.addCurve(to: CGPoint(x: 0.1877, y: 0.088), controlPoint1: CGPoint(x: 0.534, y: 0.5816), controlPoint2: CGPoint(x: 0.2529, y: 0.4205))
        path.addCurve(to: CGPoint(x: 0.9728, y: 0.8259), controlPoint1: CGPoint(x: 0.4922, y: 0.4949), controlPoint2: CGPoint(x: 1.0968, y: 0.4148))
        path.addCurve(to: CGPoint(x: 0.0397, y: 0.5431), controlPoint1: CGPoint(x: 0.7118, y: 0.5248), controlPoint2: CGPoint(x: 0.3329, y: 0.7442))
        path.addCurve(to: CGPoint(x: 0.6211, y: 0.0279), controlPoint1: CGPoint(x: 0.508, y: 1.1956), controlPoint2: CGPoint(x: 1.3042, y: 0.5345))
        path.addCurve(to: CGPoint(x: 0.6904, y: 0.3615), controlPoint1: CGPoint(x: 0.7282, y: 0.2481), controlPoint2: CGPoint(x: 0.6904, y: 0.3615))
        return path
    }
}
```

That uses control points that are normalized to the range of 0 through 1, so that I can render it inside any kind of container and just scale it up to fit the available space.

In SwiftUI that would mean creating a transform that scales the Bezier path up by the minimum of either the width or the height, then applying that to a path, like this:

```swift
struct ScaledBezier: Shape {
    let bezierPath: UIBezierPath

    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        let path = Path(bezierPath.cgPath)

        // Figure out how much bigger we need to make our path in order for it to fill the available space without clipping.
        let multiplier = min(rect.width, rect.height)

        // Create an affine transform that uses the multiplier for both dimensions equally.
        let transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: multiplier, y: multiplier)

        // Apply that scale and send back the result.
        return path.applying(transform)
    }
}

// Show our ScaledBezier shape in a view
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScaledBezier(bezierPath: .logo)
            .stroke(lineWidth: 2)
            .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
    }
}
```

If you’re starting with a `CGPath` rather than a `UIBezierPath`, things are even easier because you can write `let path = Path(yourCGPath)` to convert the path directly.
