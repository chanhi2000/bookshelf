> Updated for Xcode 15

Use the `Image` view to render images inside your SwiftUI layouts. These can load images from your bundle, from system icons, from a `UIImage`, and more, but those three will be the most common.

If you're building using Xcode 15 and later, you can load an image from your bundle and display it inside an image view using built-in static properties, like this:

```swift
Image(.dog)
```

This was introduced in Xcode 15 alongside iOS 17, but works just fine back in all older versions of iOS.

If you're using Xcode 14 and earlier, you need to write the name of your images like this:

```swift
Image("dog")
```

You also can create an image view from an existing `UIImage`. As loading a `UIImage` using its `named` initializer returns an optional image, you should either add a default value or use a force unwrap if you're sure it will exist in your asset catalog:

```swift
Image(uiImage: UIImage(named: "cat")!)
```

If you want to work with Apple's SF Symbols icon set, you should use the Image(systemName:) initializer, like this:

```swift
Image(systemName: "cloud.heavyrain.fill")
    .font(.largeTitle)
```

Notice how you can use the `font()` modifier to adjust SF Symbols as if they were text.
