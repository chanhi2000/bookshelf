> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 16**

SwiftUI's `AnyLayout` struct allows us to switch between `HStack` and `VStack` freely, based on whatever environment context we want to take into account – just remember to use the `Layout`-conforming variants of each.

For example, we might want to show a group of images horizontally when we're in a regular horizontal size class, or vertically otherwise, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var horizontalSizeClass

    var body: some View {
        let layout = horizontalSizeClass == .regular ? AnyLayout(HStackLayout()) : AnyLayout(VStackLayout())

        layout {
            Image(systemName: "1.circle")
            Image(systemName: "2.circle")
            Image(systemName: "3.circle")
        }
        .font(.largeTitle)
    }
}
```

Tip: Unlike using `AnyView`, `AnyLayout` doesn't incur any performance impact, and won't discard any of the state of its child views.

Alternatively, we could flip the axis when the user's Dynamic Type size goes beyond a certain size:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.dynamicTypeSize) var dynamicTypeSize

    var body: some View {
        let layout = dynamicTypeSize <= .xxxLarge ? AnyLayout(HStackLayout()) : AnyLayout(VStackLayout())

        layout {
            Image(systemName: "1.circle")
            Image(systemName: "2.circle")
            Image(systemName: "3.circle")
        }
        .font(.largeTitle)
    }
}
```

As well as `VStackLayout` and `HStackLayout`, you can also use `ZStackLayout` and `GridLayout`.

::: tip

Any grid rows that are used in non-grid layouts don't do anything – they become the same as using `Group`.
