> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI’s `rotation3DEffect()` modifier lets us rotate views in 3D space to create beautiful effects in almost no code. It accepts two parameters: what angle to rotate (in degrees or radians), plus a tuple containing the X, Y, and Z axis around which to perform the rotation.

::: important

If you’ve never done 3D rotation before you should think about the X/Y/Z axes as being skewers through your views. The X axis goes horizontally, so if you rotate on the X axis it’s like putting a horizontal skewer through your view – any rotation makes the top or bottom nearer or further, but won’t adjust the leading and trailing edges.

:::

So, if you wanted to rotate some text by 45 degrees around the X axis (which would cause the top of the text to look further away than the bottom), you might write this:

```swift
Text("EPISODE LLVM")
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .foregroundStyle(.yellow)
    .rotation3DEffect(.degrees(45), axis: (x: 1, y: 0, z: 0))
```

![The text “EPISODE LLVM” in yellow, distorted such that the top appears further into the screen, evoking the Star Wars opening exposition crawl.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-rotate-a-view-in-3d-1~dark@2x.png)

Yes, you can make your own Star Wars crawl in SwiftUI.
