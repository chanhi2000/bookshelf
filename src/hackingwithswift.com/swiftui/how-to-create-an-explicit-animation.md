If you attach an animation modifier to a view, you end up with implicit animation – changing some state elsewhere in your view might use animation, even though you’re just incrementing an integer or toggling a Boolean.

An alternative is to use *explicit* animation, where you don’t attach modifiers to the view in question but instead ask SwiftUI to animate the precise change you want to make. To do this, wrap your changes in a call to `withAnimation()`.

For example, this uses explicit animation to make a button fade away slightly more each time it’s tapped:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var opacity = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Press here") {
            withAnimation {
                opacity -= 0.2
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .opacity(opacity)
    }
}
```

`withAnimation()` takes a parameter specifying the kind of animation you want, so you could create a three-second linear animation like this: `withAnimation(.linear(duration: 3))`

Explicit animations are often helpful because they cause every affected view to animate, not just those that have implicit animations attached. For example, if view A has to make room for view B as part of the animation, but only view B has an animation attached, then view A will jump to its new position without animating unless you use explicit animations.
