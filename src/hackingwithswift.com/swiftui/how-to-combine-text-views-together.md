SwiftUI’s text view overloads the `+` operator so that you can combine them together to make new text views.

This is helpful for times when you need to have different formatting across your views, because you can make each text view look exactly as you want then join them together to make a single combined text view. Even better, VoiceOver automatically recognizes them as a single piece of text when it comes to reading them out.

For example, this creates three text views then uses `+` to join them into a single text view to be returned:

```swift
Text("SwiftUI ")
    .font(.largeTitle)
+ Text("is ")
    .font(.headline)
+ Text("awesome")
    .font(.footnote)
```

![A line reading “SwiftUI is awesome” with “SwiftUI” in very large text and “is” in large text](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-combine-text-views-together-1~dark@2x.png)

You can also use this technique to create different colors or font weights of text, like this:

```swift
Text("SwiftUI ")
    .foregroundStyle(.red)
+ Text("is ")
    .foregroundStyle(.orange)
    .fontWeight(.black)
+ Text("awesome")
    .foregroundStyle(.blue)
```

::: tip

Combining text views like this is as close as we get to attributed strings in SwiftUI – there is no support for using `NSAttributedString` at this time.
