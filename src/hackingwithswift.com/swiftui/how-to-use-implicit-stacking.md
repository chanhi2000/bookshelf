What happens if you create a dynamic list and put more than one thing in each row? SwiftUI's solution is simple, flexible, and gives us great behavior by default: it creates an implicit `HStack` to hold your items, so they automatically get laid out horizontally.

As an example, we could create a row where we had a small picture on the left and the remaining space be allocated to a text field, then create an array of three users and show them in a dynamic list.

Here's how that looks in code:

```swift
// An example struct to hold some data
struct User: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let username = "Anonymous"
}

// A view to create and show that data in a list
struct ContentView: View {
    let users = [User(), User(), User()]

    var body: some View {
        List(users) { user in
            Image("paul-hudson")
                .resizable()
                .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
            Text(user.username)
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how we don't need to place the image and text views into a `HStack` to have them rendered side by side – SwiftUI figures it out for us.
