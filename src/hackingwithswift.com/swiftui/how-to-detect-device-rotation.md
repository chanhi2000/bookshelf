Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI doesn't have a built-in way to detect the user rotating their device between portrait and landscape orientation, but we can make one using a custom modifier by responding to the `UIDevice.orientationDidChangeNotification` notification.

This takes three steps:

1. Creating a custom view modifier that watches for orientation changes and runs a callback function when it happens. It's not required, but we're going to make the callback accept a `UIDeviceOrientation` as its only parameter, just in case you need to know the current orientation.
2. Wrapping that view modifier up in a `View` extension so that it's easier to call.
3. Using your custom modifier in a view of your choosing.

::: important

At the time of writing view modifiers do *not* work with `onReceive()` unless you first add `onAppear()`, which is why it appears above. Yes, it's empty, but it acts as a workaround for the problem.

:::

Here's a complete code sample:

```swift
// Our custom view modifier to track rotation and
// call our action
struct DeviceRotationViewModifier: ViewModifier {
    let action: (UIDeviceOrientation) -> Void

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .onAppear()
            .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UIDevice.orientationDidChangeNotification)) { _ in
                action(UIDevice.current.orientation)
            }
    }
}

// A View wrapper to make the modifier easier to use
extension View {
    func onRotate(perform action: @escaping (UIDeviceOrientation) -> Void) -> some View {
        self.modifier(DeviceRotationViewModifier(action: action))
    }
}

// An example view to demonstrate the solution
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var orientation = UIDeviceOrientation.unknown

    var body: some View {
        Group {
            if orientation.isPortrait {
                Text("Portrait")
            } else if orientation.isLandscape {
                Text("Landscape")
            } else if orientation.isFlat {
                Text("Flat")
            } else {
                Text("Unknown")
            }
        }
        .onRotate { newOrientation in
            orientation = newOrientation
        }
    }
}
```

::: tip

This may not work while your app is connected to Xcode's debugger - try pushing your app to a real device, then running it manually rather than via Xcode.

:::

Please remember that device orientation isn't quite as useful as you might expect. Yes, on iPhone a landscape orientation means you have more horizontal space than vertical, but on iPad it's possible for your app to be running in landscape while in split-screen mode - technically the whole screen still has a larger width than height, but the actual space allocated to our app is only a small slice of that width.
