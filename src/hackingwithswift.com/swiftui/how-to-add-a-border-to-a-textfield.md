**Updated for iOS 15**

SwiftUI's `TextField` view has no styling by default, which means it's an empty space on the screen. If that fits the style you want, great – you're done. But many of us will prefer to add a border around the text field to make it clearer.

If you want to get the “rounded rect” text field style that we're used to with `UITextField`, you should use the `.textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder))` modifier, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name: String = "Tim"

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            TextField("Enter your name", text: $name)
                .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
            Text("Hello, \(name)!")
        }
    }
}
```

A text field with a thin grey border above the text “Hello Tim!”

::: important

If you're using Xcode 12 you need to use `RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle()` rather than `.roundedBorder`.
