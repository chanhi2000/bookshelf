SwiftUI's `Spacer` views automatically fill up all available space on their axis of expansion, which is a fancy way of saying they take up as much space as they can either horizontally or vertically, depending on what you put them in.

If you want to make a spacer of an exact size, just do the same thing you would do for any other kind of view: use a `frame()` modifier with the exact sizes you want.

For example, this shows two text views, with a 50-point spacer in between them:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("First Label")
    Spacer()
        .frame(height: 50)
    Text("Second Label")
}
```

If you give the spacer a range of values, for example using `.frame(minHeight: 50, maxHeight: 500)`, then it will automatically take up as much space as it can, up to the maximum you set. Adding some flexibility in this way is usually a good idea, so that your user interfaces scale across devices more easily.

There are some situations where you want to specify a spacer size agnostic to its layout direction, for example if your views might sometimes be in a `HStack` or a `VStack` and you want the spacer to add 50 points regardless of direction.

In this circumstance you should use the `minLength` initializer, like this:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("First Label")
    Spacer(minLength: 50)
    Text("Second Label")
}
```

::: note

That's a *minimum* length, so the spacer will still grow to be larger if space is available.
