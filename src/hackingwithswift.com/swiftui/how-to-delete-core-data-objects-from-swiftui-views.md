Deleting Core Data objects in SwiftUI is mostly the same as deleting them in UIKit, although there are a couple of special hoops to jump through to integrate with SwiftUI’s views.

If you followed my [Core Data and SwiftUI set up instructions](/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-configure-core-data-to-work-with-swiftui.md), you’ve already injected your managed object context into the SwiftUI environment.

Once you have your managed object context, make it available to your SwiftUI view as a property like this one:

```swift
@Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var managedObjectContext
```

Next, create a fetch request that reads some data from your managed object context. In my example setup there’s a `ProgrammingLanguage` entity, so we can read out all items like this:

```swift
@FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: [
        SortDescriptor(\.name)
    ]
) var languages: FetchedResults<ProgrammingLanguage>
```

Third, add an `onDelete` modifier to your SwiftUI view, wherever you’re showing your data. For example, using the above fetch request you might create a list using `ForEach`, like this:

```swift
List {
    ForEach(languages) { language in
        Text("Creator: \(language.creator ?? "Anonymous")")
    }
    .onDelete(perform: removeLanguages)
}
```

Finally, add the `removeLanguages()` method to your SwiftUI view. This should accept an `IndexSet`, which is a collection of unique integer indexes that should be deleted:

```swift
func removeLanguages(at offsets: IndexSet) {
    for index in offsets {
        let language = languages[index]
        managedObjectContext.delete(language)
    }
}
```

You might want to save your Core Data context at this point, in which case after the `for` loop finishes add something like this:

```swift
do {
    try managedObjectContext.save()
} catch {
    // handle the Core Data error
}
```

Or if you’re using my `PersistenceController` setup code, use this:

```swift
PersistenceController.shared.save()
```

Just adding an `onDelete()` modifier is enough to get swipe to delete on your table rows, but if you also want an Edit/Done button to toggle editing mode you should add this modifier to whatever is directly inside your `NavigationStack`:

```swift
.toolbar {
    EditButton()
}
```
