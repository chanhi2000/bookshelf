> Updated for Xcode 16

**Improved in iOS 18**

SwiftUI’s `scrollPosition()` modifier lets us make a `ScrollView` move to a specific edge of the screen, jump to the top or bottom of its content, or scroll to an exact X/Y position, all in one.

This takes three steps, starting with a new property that stores the current scroll position:

```swift
@State private var position = ScrollPosition(edge: .top)
```

Next, you need to attach to the scrollview you're working with, like this:

```swift
.scrollPosition($position)
```

And finally, you can call various methods on that `position` object to jump wherever you need:

```swift
// Go to the top or bottom edge
position.scrollTo(edge: .top)
position.scrollTo(edge: .bottom)

// Move to a particular view
position.scrollTo(id: "Avatar")

// Move to an exact X/Y coordinate
position.scrollTo(x: 0, y: 500)
```

Generally speaking I think you're likely to make ID-based scrolling your first choice, then edges, and finally exact coordinates last.

Here's a complete example, showing you how to move through items in a list in three different ways:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var position = ScrollPosition(edge: .top)

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ScrollView {
                ForEach(0..<100) { i in
                    Text("Item \(i)")
                        .padding()
                        .id(i)
                }
            }
            .scrollPosition($position)

            HStack(spacing: 50) {
                Button("Top") {
                    position.scrollTo(edge: .top)
                }

                Button("Bottom") {
                    position.scrollTo(edge: .bottom)
                }

                Button("Random") {
                    position.scrollTo(id: Int.random(in: 0..<100))
                }
            }
        }
        .font(.title)
    }
}
```
