> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `VideoPlayer` view lets us playback movies from any URL, local or remote. It comes from the AVKit framework, so you should make sure and add `import AVKit` before trying it out.

As an example, if you had video.mp4 in your app bundle and wanted to play it back, you'd use this:

```swift
VideoPlayer(player: AVPlayer(url:  Bundle.main.url(forResource: "video", withExtension: "mp4")!))
    .frame(height: 400)
```

::: info Reminder

You need to add `import AVKit` to your Swift file to use this.

:::

And if you want to play a remote video, use its remote URL instead:

```swift
VideoPlayer(player: AVPlayer(url:  URL(string: "https://bit.ly/swswift")!))
    .frame(height: 400)
```

If you want, you can provide a second parameter to the `VideoPlayer` initializer that adds content to be drawn over the video. This will be drawn below the system video controls, but can respond to any events that aren't caught by those controls.

For example, this places the text “Watermark” at the very top of the video area:

```swift
VideoPlayer(player: AVPlayer(url:  URL(string: "https://bit.ly/swswift")!)) {
    VStack {
        Text("Watermark")
            .foregroundStyle(.black)
            .background(.white.opacity(0.7))
        Spacer()
    }
    .frame(width: 400, height: 300)
}
```
