> Updated for Xcode 15

By default SwiftUI's views take up only as much space as they need, but if you want that to change you can use a frame() modifier to tell SwiftUI what kind of size range you want to have.

For example, you could create a button with a 200x200 tappable area like this:

```swift
Button {
    print("Button tapped")
} label: {
    Text("Welcome")
        .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: 200, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: 200)
        .font(.largeTitle)
}
```

Or you could make a text view fill the whole screen (minus the safe area) by specifying a frame with zero for its minimum width and height, and infinity for its maximum width and height, like this:

```swift
Text("Please log in")
    .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 0, maxHeight: .infinity)
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
    .background(.red)
```

::: note

if you want a view to go under the safe area, make sure you add the `ignoresSafeArea()` modifier.
