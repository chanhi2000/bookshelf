> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated in iOS 15**

SwiftUI's button is similar to `UIButton`, except it's more flexible in terms of what content it shows and it uses a closure for its action rather than the old target/action system.

To create a button with a string title you would start with code like this:

```swift
Button("Button title") {
    print("Button tapped!")
}
```

![The words “Button title” in blue, indicating they are tappable.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-create-a-tappable-button-1~dark.png)

For example, you might make a button that shows or hides some detail text when it's tapped:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDetails = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Button("Show details") {
                showDetails.toggle()
            }

            if showDetails {
                Text("You should follow me on Twitter: @twostraws")
                    .font(.largeTitle)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The title inside the button can be any kind of view, so you can create an image button like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showDetails = false

    var body: some View {
        Button {
            print("Image tapped!")
        } label: {
            Image("sunset")
        }
    }
}
```

Using a custom label is really helpful for times you want to increase the tappable area of a button, because you can apply padding to the label then use `contentShape(Rectangle())` or similar to make the whole area tappable.

For example, this adds 20 points of padding to a button's label, to ensure it's tappable in a much larger space than would otherwise be possible:

```swift
Button {
    print("Button pressed")
} label: {
    Text("Press Me")
        .padding(20)
}
.contentShape(Rectangle())
```

If you're targeting iOS 15 or later, you can also attach a *role* to your button that helps SwiftUI know what kind of styling should be attached to the button. For example, if we had a Delete button we might mark it with the `.destructive` role so SwiftUI can highlight it in red when it makes sense:

```swift
Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
    print("Perform delete")
}
```

![The word “Delete” in red.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-create-a-tappable-button-5~dark.png)

There's also a `.cancel` role, and again it gives SwiftUI that extra bit of context to present it appropriately.
