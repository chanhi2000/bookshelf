> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 16**

SwiftUI's `MultiDatePicker` shows a calendar view where the user is able to select a variety of dates at the same time, either from any possible date or from a date range of your choosing.

In its simplest form, you just need some sort of state to track which dates they have chosen, then bind that to your picker:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var dates: Set<DateComponents> = []

    var body: some View {
        MultiDatePicker("Select your preferred dates", selection: $dates)
    }
}
```

However, chances are you're going to want to convert those date components to real dates, in which case you'll want to read the user's calendar from the environment and convert the data as needed:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.calendar) var calendar
    @State var dates: Set<DateComponents> = []

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            MultiDatePicker("Select your preferred dates", selection: $dates)

            Text(summary)
        }
        .padding()
    }

    var summary: String {
        dates.compactMap { components in
            calendar.date(from: components)?.formatted(date: .long, time: .omitted)
        }.formatted()
    }
}
```

By default, the user is able to choose any dates they like, but you can also restrict their selection to a range of your choosing. For example, this code allows them to select any date from today onwards, but nothing earlier:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.calendar) var calendar
    @State var dates: Set<DateComponents> = []

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            MultiDatePicker("Select your preferred dates", selection: $dates, in: Date.now...)

            Text(summary)
        }
        .padding()
    }

    var summary: String {
        dates.compactMap { components in
            calendar.date(from: components)?.formatted(date: .long, time: .omitted)
        }.formatted()
    }
}
```
