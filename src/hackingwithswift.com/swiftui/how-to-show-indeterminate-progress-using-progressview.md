> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `ProgressView` can be created without any sort of binding attached, which will cause them to become indeterminate – they will show a spinner that animates forever, rather than showing some sort of clear progress.

All it takes is code like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ProgressView("Downloading…")
    }
}
```
