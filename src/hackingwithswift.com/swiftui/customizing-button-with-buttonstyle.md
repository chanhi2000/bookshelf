> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI has a number of styling protocols that allow us to define common styling for views such as `Button`, `ProgressView`, `Toggle`, and more. They all work by allowing us to centralize any number of modifiers that get a view looking the way we want it, and provide modifiers that let us apply the full set of customizations in a single line.

For example, here’s a button that has its styling declared inline:

```swift
Button("Press Me") {
    print("Button pressed!")
}
.padding()
.background(Color(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0.5))
.clipShape(Capsule())
```

That works fine for a single button, but if that’s the standard button design across your entire app you should consider using a custom button style instead. This means creating a new struct that conforms to the 
`ButtonStyle` protocol, which will pass us the button’s configuration to act on however we want.

So, we could centralize those three modifiers into a single 
`BlueButton` style, then apply it to our button like this:

```swift
struct BlueButton: ButtonStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.label
            .padding()
            .background(Color(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0.5))
            .foregroundStyle(.white)
            .clipShape(Capsule())
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Button("Press Me") {
            print("Button pressed!")
        }
        .buttonStyle(BlueButton())
    }
}
```

The button configuration we’re passed includes whether the button is currently being pressed or not, so we can us that to adjust our button.

For example, we could create a second style that makes the button grow when it’s being pressed down:

```swift
struct GrowingButton: ButtonStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.label
            .padding()
            .background(.blue)
            .foregroundStyle(.white)
            .clipShape(Capsule())
            .scaleEffect(configuration.isPressed ? 1.2 : 1)
            .animation(.easeOut(duration: 0.2), value: configuration.isPressed)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Button("Press Me") {
            print("Button pressed!")
        }
        .buttonStyle(GrowingButton())
    }
}
```
