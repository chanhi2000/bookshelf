> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI lets us disable any part of its forms or even the whole form, all by using the `disabled()` modifier. This takes a single Boolean that defines whether the element should be disabled or not. The form element's style automatically gets updated to reflect its status - buttons and toggles get grayed out, for example.

For example, this creates a form with two sections: one containing a toggle, and one containing a button that is enabled only when the toggle is on:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var agreedToTerms = false

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            Section {
                Toggle("Agree to terms and conditions", isOn: $agreedToTerms)
            }

            Section {
                Button("Continue") {
                    print("Thank you!")
                }
                .disabled(agreedToTerms == false)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, the button is disabled just by adding `disabled(agreedToTerms == false)` to the list of modifiers.

Like many other SwiftUI modifiers, you can lift `disabled()` so that it's run on the section or even the whole form depending on what behavior you want - just move it to come after the section, for example.
