> Updated for Xcode 15

Any SwiftUI view can be partially or wholly transparent using the `opacity()` modifier. This accepts a value between 0 (completely invisible) and 1 (fully opaque), just like the `alpha` property of `UIView` in UIKit.

For example, this creates a text view with a red background, then gives it 30% opacity:

```swift
Text("Now you see me")
    .padding()
    .background(.red)
    .opacity(0.3)
```

Modifying opacity is extremely fast – certainly something you can do as often as you need. To demonstrate that, the following code adjusts text opacity using a slider, and you’ll see you can move it around as fast and as much as you like without any performance hit:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var opacity = 0.5

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Now you see me")
                .padding()
                .background(.red)
                .opacity(opacity)

            Slider(value: $opacity, in: 0...1)
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```
