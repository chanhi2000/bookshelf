> Updated for Xcode 15

In SwiftUI, any macOS app or any iPadOS app where a mouse is connected can detect when the user is hovering their pointer over a view, and respond to it appropriately.

There are two modifiers you'll want to use: `onHover()`, and `hoverEffect()`. The first of these allows you to track whether the pointer is currently hovering over the view, and is passed a Boolean reflecting that state. For example, this will color some text red or green depending on whether the pointer is hovering over it or not:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var overText = false

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .foregroundStyle(overText ? .green : .red)
            .onHover { over in
                overText = over
            }
    }
}
```

The `hoverEffect()` modifier allows you to choose one of three ways the system can highlight the view when a hover happens: `.highlight` transforms the pointer into the shape of the view while creating a gentle directional effect, `.lift` transforms the pointer into the shape of the view while scaling up the view and placing a soft shadow behind it, and `.automatic` selects whichever highlight effect it thinks is most appropriate.

Note that `.automatic` is the default if you just apply the `hoverEffect()` modifier without any parameters, but it *isn't* just selecting between `.highlight` and `.lift` - it's quite a different effect, and won't transform the pointer to match the shape of your view.

To try it out, here's some code that places a tappable text label on the screen, giving it a `.lift` hover effect to make it clear that it's tappable:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Tap me!")
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .hoverEffect(.lift)
            .onTapGesture {
                print("Text tapped")
            }
    }
}
```
