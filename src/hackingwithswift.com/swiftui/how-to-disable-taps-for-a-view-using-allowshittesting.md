> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI lets us stop a view from receiving any kind of taps using the `allowsHitTesting()` modifier. If hit testing is disallowed for a view, any taps automatically continue through the view on to whatever is behind it.

To demonstrate this, here's a `ZStack` containing a translucent rectangle with a button underneath:

```swift
ZStack {
    Button("Tap Me") {
        print("Button was tapped")
    }
    .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
    .background(.gray)

    Rectangle()
        .fill(.red.opacity(0.2))
        .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
        .clipShape(Circle())
        .allowsHitTesting(false)
}
```

Even though the rectangle is on top of the button, it has `allowsHitTesting(false)` - any taps on the rectangle won't be trapped by the rectangle, but instead passed through to the button below.

This kind of effect is useful for when you want to highlight one view with another - the red circle above might be part of a tutorial saying “Tap here to get started”, and that wouldn't work if the circle itself caught the tap.
