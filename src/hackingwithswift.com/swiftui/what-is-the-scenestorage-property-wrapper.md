If you want to save unique data for each of your screens, you should use SwiftUI’s `@SceneStorage` property wrapper. This works a bit like `@AppStorage` in that you provide it with a name to save things plus a default value, but rather than working with `UserDefaults` it instead gets used for state restoration - and it even works great with the kinds of complex multi-scene set ups we see so often in iPadOS.

For example, if you have a text editor and want to store what the user was typing, you should use this kind of code:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @SceneStorage("text") var text = ""

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            TextEditor(text: $text)
        }
    }
}
```

Because that uses `@SceneStorage`, SwiftUI will automatically make sure that each scene instance has its own copy of the text - if you run the app side by side both will save and restore their data correctly.

Now, before you use `@SceneStorage` there are some important warnings from Apple:

- Don’t save lots of data; save just what you need for state restoration.
- Never store sensitive data in scene storage, because it isn’t secure.
- If the user goes to the app switcher and destroys your app, the scene storage is also destroyed.
