> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated in iOS 15**

SwiftUI's `GroupBox` view groups views together and places a light background color behind them so they stand out. You can optionally also include a header to make group titles, if you need to.

By default `GroupBox` with align its views vertically. For example, this will show three text views one above the other:

```swift
GroupBox {
    Text("Your account")
        .font(.headline)
    Text("Username: tswift89")
    Text("City: Nashville")
}
```

If you want to control that layout, such as changing axis or adjusting the alignment, create a stack yourself:

```swift
GroupBox {
    VStack(alignment: .leading) {
        Text("Your account")
            .font(.headline)
        Text("Username: tswift89")
        Text("City: Nashville")
    }
}
```

One real power feature of `GroupBox` is that if you nest them they will automatically adapt their colors so they are neatly distinguished:

```swift
GroupBox {
    Text("Outer Content")

    GroupBox {
        Text("Middle Content")

        GroupBox {
            Text("Inner Content")
        }
    }
}
```

![Three concentric rounded rectangles, each containing a line of text, and the inner rectangle(s).](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-group-views-visually-using-groupbox-3~dark@2x.png)

This effect works just as well - if not better! - in dark mode.

Like I said, you *can* add titles to your `GroupBox` and although it looks okay on macOS it doesn't look nice at all on iOS:

```swift
GroupBox("Your account") {
    VStack(alignment: .leading) {
        Text("Username: tswift89")
        Text("City: Nashville")
    }
}
```

Beside it is an iPhone with similar contents consuming horizontal space, resulting in a visual imbalance.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-group-views-visually-using-groupbox-4~dark@2x.png)
