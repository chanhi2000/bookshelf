When placing one view over another, you can control the way they overlap by using the `blendMode()` modifier. This contains a variety of ways you can mix colors together, such as using their difference or using a color burn - these will be familiar if you’ve used Core Graphics or something like Photoshop before.

To demonstrate this we could create a `ZStack` with two overlapping circles inside, where the second has a `.multiply` blend mode so that it darkens the colors behind it:

```swift
ZStack {
    Circle()
        .fill(.red)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .offset(x: -50)
        .blendMode(.screen)

    Circle()
        .fill(.blue)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .offset(x: 50)
        .blendMode(.screen)
}
.frame(width: 400)
```
