Fetch requests allow us to load Core Data results that match specific criteria we specify, and SwiftUI can bind those results directly to user interface elements.

If you followed my [Core Data and SwiftUI set up instructions](/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-configure-core-data-to-work-with-swiftui.md), you’ve already injected your managed object context into the SwiftUI environment. 

**That step is required.** I know, you just want to know how to run a Core Data fetch request and show data inside a SwiftUI list, but if you don’t follow the steps in the link above then using `@FetchRequest` will crash at runtime because SwiftUI expects that setup to have been done.

Once your managed object context is attached to the environment under the `.managedObjectContext` key, you can use the `@FetchRequest` property wrapper to make properties in your views that create and manage Core Data fetch requests automatically.

Creating a fetch request requires two pieces of information: the entity you want to query, and a sort descriptor that determines the order in which results are returned. In my example setup we created a ProgrammingLanguages entity that had name and creator attributes, so we could create a fetch request for it like this:

```swift
@FetchRequest(sortDescriptors: [SortDescriptor(\.name)]) var languages: FetchedResults<ProgrammingLanguage>
```

That loads all programming languages, sorted alphabetically by their name. 

As you can see, the `sortDescriptors` parameter is an array, so you can provide as many sorting options as you need like this:

```swift
@FetchRequest(sortDescriptors: [SortDescriptor(\.name), SortDescriptor(\.creator, order: .reverse)]) var languages: FetchedResults<ProgrammingLanguage>
```

Yes, that’s a massive line of code, so I wouldn’t blame you if you broke it up into something a little easier to read:

```swift
@FetchRequest(sortDescriptors: [
    SortDescriptor(\.name),
    SortDescriptor(\.creator, order: .reverse)
]) var languages: FetchedResults<ProgrammingLanguage>
```

Regardless of how you create your fetch request, the results can be used directly inside SwiftUI views. For example, we could show a table of all languages like this:

```swift
List(languages) { language in
    Text(language.name ?? "Unknown")
}
```
