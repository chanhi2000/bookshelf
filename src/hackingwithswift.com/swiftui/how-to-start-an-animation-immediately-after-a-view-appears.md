If you want a SwiftUI view to start animating as soon as it appears, you should use the `nAppear()` modifier to attach an animation. I’ll show you the basic code first, then show you two extensions I use to make this process easier.

First, the simple version - this creates a circle that scales up and down forever:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var scale = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
            .scaleEffect(scale)
            .onAppear {
                let baseAnimation = Animation.easeInOut(duration: 1)
                let repeated = baseAnimation.repeatForever(autoreverses: true)

                withAnimation(repeated) {
                    scale = 0.5
                }
            }
    }
}
```

If you intend to add initial animations frequently, it’s a smart idea to add some extensions to the `View` protocol to make it easier.

To demonstrate this, the two extensions below add `animate()` and `animateForever()` modifiers that let you customize the animation you want and also wrap up the whole behavior neatly:

```swift
// Create an immediate animation.
extension View {
    func animate(using animation: Animation = .easeInOut(duration: 1), _ action: @escaping () -> Void) -> some View {
        onAppear {
            withAnimation(animation) {
                action()
            }
        }
    }
}

// Create an immediate, looping animation
extension View {
    func animateForever(using animation: Animation = .easeInOut(duration: 1), autoreverses: Bool = false, _ action: @escaping () -> Void) -> some View {
        let repeated = animation.repeatForever(autoreverses: autoreverses)

        return onAppear {
            withAnimation(repeated) {
                action()
            }
        }
    }
}

// Try out our extensions with the scaling circle.
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var scale = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
            .scaleEffect(scale)
            .animateForever(autoreverses: true) { scale = 0.5 }
    }
}
```
