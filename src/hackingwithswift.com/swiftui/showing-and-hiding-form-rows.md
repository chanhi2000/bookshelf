> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI lets us add and remove items from a form as needed, which is particularly helpful when you want to adjust the list of options that are visible based on previous choices.

For example, this shows a single toggle that prompts the user whether they want to show more advanced options. When that toggle is enabled, a second toggle appears allowing them to enable logging:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAdvancedOptions = false
    @State private var enableLogging = false

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            Section {
                Toggle("Show advanced options", isOn: $showingAdvancedOptions.animation())

                if showingAdvancedOptions {
                    Toggle("Enable logging", isOn: $enableLogging)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<VidStack src="https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/showing-and-hiding-form-rows-1~dark.mp4" />

Notice how I attached `animation()` to the `$showingAdvancedOptions` binding, to enable implicit animations for view changes made as a result of any binding change.
