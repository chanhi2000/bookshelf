> Updated for Xcode 15

The `blur()` modifier lets us apply a real-time Gaussian blur to our views, at a strength of our choosing.

For example, this creates a 300x300 profile picture, then adds a 20-point Gaussian blur:

```swift
Image("dog")
    .resizable()
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
    .blur(radius: 20)
```

You can blur anything you want, including text views:


```swift
Text("Welcome to my SwiftUI app")
    .blur(radius: 2)
```

Blurring is extremely efficient, and you can adjust it dynamically just like any other kind of state. For example, this lets you try adjusting the blur of our text dynamically by dragging around a slider:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var blurAmount = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Drag the slider to blur me")
                .blur(radius: blurAmount)

            Slider(value: $blurAmount, in: 0...20)
        }
    }
}
```
