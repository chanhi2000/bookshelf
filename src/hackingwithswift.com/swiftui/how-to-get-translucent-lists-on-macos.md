> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated for iOS 15**

One subtle but important feature of macOS is the way sidebars are automatically made slightly transparent when a window is active, then made opaque when the window moves to the background - it’s a small hint to the user which window is active, but also lets a little of their background show through, giving them a little context of their environment.

SwiftUI allows us to create these translucent sidebars using the `listStyle()` modifier on `List`, passing in `.sidebar` (or `SidebarListStyle()` for Xcode 12) like this:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    List(1..<51) {
         Text("\($0)")
    }
    .listStyle(.sidebar)
}
```

::: important

If you’re using Xcode 12 you need to use `SidebarListStyle()` rather than `.sidebar`.

:::

There’s nothing stopping you from using that with any list, but the clue is in the name: it’s specifically designed for lists that are shown on the side of your main window, as you can see in Xcode’s navigators.

Note: on iOS and iPadOS, `.sidebar` does not provide translucent background, but does affect the cell styling.

![An inactive macOS window with an opaque sidebar, an active macOS window with a translucent sidebar, an iPad with a list, and an iPhone with a list. The iPad and iPhone lists have gray backgrounds and no list-item separators.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-get-translucent-lists-on-macos-1~dark@2x.png)
