SwiftUI’s `onScrollGeometryChange()` modifier lets us be notified when a scroll view changes its content size (how much content it has), content offset (how far the user has scrolled), and more. The API is a little tricky to understand, so I'll show you an example then explain.

This code shows a scrolling list of rows. There is only 1 row at first, but another row is added every time you press a button:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var counter = 1

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ScrollView {
                ForEach(0..<counter, id: \.self) { i in
                    Text("Row \(i)")
                }
            }
            .onScrollGeometryChange(for: Double.self) { geo in
                geo.contentSize.height
            } action: { oldValue, newValue in
                print("Height is now \(newValue)")
            }

            Button("Add a row") {
                counter += 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The important part is at the end: `onScrollGeometryChange()`. The parameters I've provided are:

- `Double.self`. This means we intend to focus on some kind of `Double` value. It doesn't say what it means, only that it will be a `Double`.
- A trailing closure that accepts a `geo` parameter. This is a `ScrollGeometry` object, which is what lets us read the content size, offset, insets, and more. This must return a `Double`, because that's what we said would happen in the first parameter, and you should send back the value you want to watch.
- A second trailing closure called `action`, which is called when the watched value from the previous closure changes.

So, we're saying we want to watch the height of our content size, and whenever it changes print out the new value.

`ScrollGeometry` has a variety of different values we can read, but be careful: if you watch a value that changes extremely frequently, you're generating a *lot* of work for SwiftUI and it's going to be pretty CPU-intensive.

For example, you could track the exact scroll offset of your scroll view like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var yOffset = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ScrollView {
                ForEach(0..<100, id: \.self) { i in
                    Text("Row \(i)")
                }
            }
            .onScrollGeometryChange(for: Double.self) { geo in
                geo.contentOffset.y
            } action: { oldValue, newValue in
                yOffset = newValue
            }

            Text("Offset: \(yOffset)")
        }
    }
}
```

::: important

To be absolutely clear, that `action` closure will fire a *lot* when the user scrolls, and updating the UI 120 times a second will really burn through the user's battery. I would strongly recommend against using the above code in a shipping project, but hopefully at least it shows you how this modifier works!

:::

Here are some tips to help you make the most of this API without overloading SwiftUI:

- Your transform closure will be called extremely frequently, so make it as fast as you can and make its return value change as *infrequently* as you can - you want to reduce how often your action closure is called.
- Boiling your transformation down to a Boolean (e.g. "are we at least past Y100" or "has the user moved to a negative scroll position?") is very efficient, because it flips states rarely and therefore calls your action closure rarely too.
- If your action closure needs to update views, do so very carefully - if you're changing multiple views every time the user scrolls down a single point, you'll easily find your scroll performance is poor.
- If possible, consider using `visualEffect()` or `scrollTransition()` instead.
