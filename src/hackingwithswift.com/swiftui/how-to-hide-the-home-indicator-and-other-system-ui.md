> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 16**

SwiftUI's `persistentSystemOverlays()` modifier lets us show or hide the so-called “non-transient system views” that are automatically placed over our UI – Apple's name for the home indicator, the multitask indicator on iPad, and more.

For example, this will request to hide the overlays:

```swift
Text("This needs to take up lots of space")
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
    .background(.yellow)
    .persistentSystemOverlays(.hidden)
```

::: note

This is a *request* to hide the overlays – it's down to the system to decide what it actually do.
