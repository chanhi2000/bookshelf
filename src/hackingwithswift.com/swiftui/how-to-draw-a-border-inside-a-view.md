> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI gives us both `stroke()` and `strokeBorder()` modifiers for drawing borders around shapes, and they have subtly different behavior:

- The `strokeBorder()` modifier insets the view by half your border width then applies the stroke, meaning that the entire border is drawn inside the view.
- The `stroke()` modifier draws a border centered on the view’s edge, meaning that half the border is inside the view and half outside.

::: important

Both of these modifiers only apply to shapes - you can use `stroke()` and `strokeBorder()` with `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Capsule`, and so on, but not with `Text`, `Image` or other non-shape views. If you want to draw a border around non-shape views, you should use the `border()` modifier instead - see “[How to draw a border around a view](/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-draw-a-border-around-a-view.md)”.

:::

If you want to see `strokeBorder()` in action, try this:

```swift
Circle()
    .strokeBorder(.blue, lineWidth: 50)
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
    .padding()
```

![A thick blue circular ring.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-draw-a-border-inside-a-view-1~dark@2x.png)

Because that uses `strokeBorder()`, the 50-point blue stroke will be drawn entirely inside the circle.

If you aren’t quite sure of the difference from `stroke()`, try changing your code to this:

```swift
Circle()
    .stroke(.blue, lineWidth: 50)
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
    .padding()
```

> [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-file-zipper"/>Download this as an Xcode project](https://hackingwithswift.com/files/projects/swiftui/how-to-draw-a-border-inside-a-view-2.zip)

![A larger thick blue circular ring.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-draw-a-border-inside-a-view-2~dark@2x.png)

Now you’ll see the circle looks bigger because the stroke is drawn half inside and half outside the circle.
