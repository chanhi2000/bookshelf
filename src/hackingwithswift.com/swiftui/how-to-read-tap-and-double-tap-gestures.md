> Updated for Xcode 15

Any SwiftUI view can have tap actions attached, and you can specify how many taps should be received before the action is triggered.

For example, this creates a text view that will print a message when tapped:

```swift
Text("Tap me!")
    .onTapGesture {
        print("Tapped!")
    }
```

And this creates an image view that will print a message when double tapped:

```swift
Image("singapore")
    .onTapGesture(count: 2) {
        print("Double tapped!")
    }
```
