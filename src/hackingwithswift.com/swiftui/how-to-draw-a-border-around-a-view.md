> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI gives us a dedicated `border()` modifier to draw borders around views. It has a few variations depending on whether you want to specify a stroke width or a corner radius, so here are a few examples:

This adds a simple 1-point green border around a text view:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .border(.green)
```

![The text “Hacking with Swift” with a thin rectangular green border. There is almost no space between the text's edges and the border.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-draw-a-border-around-a-view-1~dark@2x.png)

If you want to make the border so that it doesn’t sit right on the edges of your view, add some padding first:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .padding()
    .border(.green)
```

This adds a 4-point red border:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .padding()
    .border(.red, width: 4)
```

If you want anything more advanced - e.g., if you want to round the corners of your border - you need to use the `overlay()` modifier instead. For example, this adds a 4-point blue border with 16-point rounded corners:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .padding()
    .overlay(
        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 16)
            .stroke(.blue, lineWidth: 4)
    )
```

::: tip

Use `stroke()` or `strokeBorder()` with shapes, and `border()` with other view types.
