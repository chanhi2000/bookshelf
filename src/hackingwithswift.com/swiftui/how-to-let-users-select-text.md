**New in iOS 15**

Swift's Text views represent static, unselectable text by default, but you can change that using the `.textSelection()` modifier with the `.enabled` value.

For example, this makes some text the user can select, and some the user cannot:

```swift
VStack(spacing: 50) {
    Text("You can't touch this")

    Text("Break it down!")
        .textSelection(.enabled)
}
```

![The line “You can't touch this” above the line “Break it down!”. A selection menu hovers over the second line.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-let-users-select-text-1~dark.png)

When text is selected, the user automatically gains access to the regular text actions such as Copy and Share. However, right now at least the whole text area is copied – you don't get a text selection loupe, so you can't select just a few words.

Setting `textSelection()` on any kind of group of views will automatically make all text inside that group selectable. For example, we could make both text views in our previous example selectable by moving the modifier up to the stack:

```swift
VStack(spacing: 50) {
    Text("You can't touch this")
    Text("Break it down!")
}
.textSelection(.enabled)
```

You can even apply `textSelection()` to a list, in which case the text rows in the list become selectable:

```swift
List(0..<100) { index in
    Text("Row \(index)")
}
.textSelection(.enabled)
```

::: tip

You need to press and hold directly on the text in a row rather than anywhere else.
