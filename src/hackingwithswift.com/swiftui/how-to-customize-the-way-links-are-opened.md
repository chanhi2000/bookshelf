When your user taps a URL shown inside a SwiftUI `Text` or `Link` view, it will open in Safari by default. However, you can customize this behavior by replacing the `openURL` environment key – you might want to handle the link entirely, or perhaps pass it back to the system to open once your custom action completes.

For example, this code adjusts both a `Link` and a `Text` view so that all URLs are sent to a `handleURL()` method to be acted on:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Link("Visit Apple", destination: URL(string: "https://apple.com")!)
            Text("[Visit Apple](https://apple.com)")
        }
        .environment(\.openURL, OpenURLAction(handler: handleURL))
    }

    func handleURL(_ url: URL) -> OpenURLAction.Result {
        print("Handle \(url) somehow")
        return .handled
    }
}
```

As you can see, `handleURL()` returns a `OpenURLAction.Result` value of `.handled`, which means the method accepted the link and acted on it. There are alternatives:

- Use `.discarded` if you mean you weren't able to handle the link.
- Use `.systemAction` if you want to trigger the default behavior, perhaps in addition to your own logic.
- Use `.systemAction(someOtherURL)` if you want to open a different URL using the default behavior, perhaps a modified version of the URL that was originally triggered.

Remember, links will use your app's accent color by default, but you can change that using the `tint()` modifier:

```swift
Text("[Visit Apple](https://apple.com)")
    .tint(.indigo)
```
