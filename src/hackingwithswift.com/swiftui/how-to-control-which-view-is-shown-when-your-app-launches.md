> Updated for Xcode 15

When you make a new SwiftUI project, Xcode will automatically create a new Swift file with the same name as your project, which will be used to bootstrap your app – to present your initial user interface.

For example, the default file will look like this:

```swift
struct SwiftUITestApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

So, you can just change `ContentView` to whatever other view you want to show.

However, this is a great place to set up all the core UI you need, such as a tab view:

```swift
WindowGroup {
    TabView {
        HomeView()
        ContactsView()
        LocationView()
        AccountView()
    }
}
```
