> Updated for Xcode 15

This guide is called SwiftUI by Example, because it focuses particularly on providing as many examples as possible, with each one solving real problems you'll face every day.

I have literally tried to structure this so that almost every entry starts with “How to…” because this is about giving you hands-on code you can use in your own projects immediately. That also means I've tried to get to the point as fast as possible and stay there, so if you're looking for a longer, slower introduction to SwiftUI I'm afraid this isn't it.

## Already got some experience?

If you've already grabbed the basics of SwiftUI and just want code that solves your problems, by all means just jump in wherever interests you.

My code examples are specifically written for folks who are following along more or less linearly, so if you're want to make those changes you may need to do a little light editing to make it fit your code.

## Just starting out?

If you're just starting out with SwiftUI you should read this guide in a roughly linear order - just keep reading and clicking Next until you're done. As far as possible I've written the guide so that later chapters build on earlier ones, so a linear approach really is a good idea.

If this is you, you should start by creating a new iOS app using the App template. It doesn't matter what you call it - it's just a sandbox where you can try out various code as you progress.
