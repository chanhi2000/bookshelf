SwiftUI provides a special, debug-only method call we can use to identify what change caused a view to reload itself. The method is specifically for debugging, and should *not* be shipped in a real app, but it’s extremely helpful for the times when you can see a view is reinvoking its `body` property but you’re not sure why.

The method is `Self._printChanges()`, and should be called *inside* the `body` property. This means you may temporarily need to add an explicit return to send back your regular view code.

To demonstrate this method in action, here’s some sample code where a view relies on an observable object that randomly issues change notifications:

```swift
class EvilStateObject: ObservableObject {
    var timer: Timer?

    init() {
        timer = Timer.scheduledTimer(
            withTimeInterval: 1,
            repeats: true
        ) { _ in
            if Int.random(in: 1...5) == 1 {
                self.objectWillChange.send()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var evilObject = EvilStateObject()

    var body: some View {
        let _ = Self._printChanges()
        Text("What could possibly go wrong?")
    }
}
```

[<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-twitter-x"/>Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1379483193708052480) has a helpful tip for discovering when the `body` property of a view is being reinvoked: assign a random background color to one of its views. This will be re-evaluated along with the rest of the body, so if `body` is being called a lot then your views will flicker as they change background.

To use this in your own projects, first add the following `Color` extension to get random colors:

```swift
extension ShapeStyle where Self == Color {
    static var random: Color {
        Color(
            red: .random(in: 0...1),
            green: .random(in: 0...1),
            blue: .random(in: 0...1)
        )
    }
}
```

And now go ahead and use it with `background()` whenever you’re curious what’s happening:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, world!")
            .background(.random)
    }
}
```
