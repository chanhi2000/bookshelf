**New in iOS 15**

If you use SF Symbols in SwiftUI's `Image` view, you can get simple colors using the `foregroundStyle()` modifier, or enable their multicolor variants by using `.renderingMode(.original)`. However, for extra flexibility over individual parts of the image, you can use the _hierarchical_ variant or provide a completely custom palette.

Hierarchical rendering uses opacity to create variations in shade on-screen. For example, this will draw the image in transparency to provide extra depth and clarity:

```swift
Image(systemName: "theatermasks")
    .symbolRenderingMode(.hierarchical)
    .font(.system(size: 144))
```

Hierarchical rendering works in combination with foreground color, so you can specify both if you need to:

```swift
Image(systemName: "theatermasks")
    .symbolRenderingMode(.hierarchical)
    .foregroundStyle(.blue)
    .font(.system(size: 144))
```

For even more power, you can use the `.palette` variant to get complete control over the colors in the image. So, we could render the SharePlay icon both blue and black at the same time, like this:

```swift
Image(systemName: "shareplay")
    .symbolRenderingMode(.palette)
    .foregroundStyle(.blue, .black)
    .font(.system(size: 144))
```

How those colors are applied depends on each individual symbol – sometimes symbols are defined with two layers and sometimes three, and you'll need to explore them individually to see how they break down.

For symbols that contain three variants, just add an extra color:

```swift
Image(systemName: "person.3.sequence.fill")
    .symbolRenderingMode(.palette)
    .foregroundStyle(.blue, .green, .red)
    .font(.system(size: 144))
```

This even works with complex foreground styles, such as providing one gradient for each person in the icon:

```swift
Image(systemName: "person.3.sequence.fill")
    .symbolRenderingMode(.palette)
    .foregroundStyle(
        .linearGradient(colors: [.red, .black], startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottomTrailing),
        .linearGradient(colors: [.green, .black], startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottomTrailing),
        .linearGradient(colors: [.blue, .black], startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottomTrailing)
    )
    .font(.system(size: 144))
```
