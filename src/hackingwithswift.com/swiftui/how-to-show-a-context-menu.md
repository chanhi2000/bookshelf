> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI gives us the `ContextMenu` modifier for creating popup menus in our apps. In iOS this is usually triggered with a long press, but it works just the same as a right-click on macOS - it’s a flexible API.

A context menu is built from a collection of buttons, each with their own action, text, and icon. The text and icon can be provided directly inside the button, because SwiftUI will provide an implicit `HStack` to make sure they fit the system standard look and feel.

So, if we wanted a context menu to be attached to some text, we could provide two buttons for the menu like this:

```swift
Text("Options")
    .contextMenu {
        Button {
            print("Change country setting")
        } label: {
            Label("Choose Country", systemImage: "globe")
        }

        Button {
            print("Enable geolocation")
        } label: {
            Label("Detect Location", systemImage: "location.circle")
        }
    }
```

To try that out on iOS, long press on the “Options” text to bring up the menu, or right-click on macOS. It’s worth adding that you can attach these sorts of menus to any SwiftUI views, not just text views.
