SwiftUI's `Image` view has the ability to be scaled in different ways, just like the content mode of a `UIImageView`.

By default, image views automatically size themselves to their contents, which might make them go beyond the screen. If you add the `resizable()` modifier then the image will instead automatically be sized so that it fills all the available space, either in a frame you specify or whatever is available on the screen:

```swift
Image("rome")
    .resizable()
    .frame(height: 200)
```

However, that may also cause the image to have its original aspect ratio distorted, because it will be stretched in all dimensions by whatever amount is needed to make it fill the space.

If you want to keep its aspect ratio you should add an `aspectRatio` modifier using either `.fill` or `.fit`, like this:

```swift
Image("rome")
    .resizable()
    .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
    .frame(width: 250)
```
