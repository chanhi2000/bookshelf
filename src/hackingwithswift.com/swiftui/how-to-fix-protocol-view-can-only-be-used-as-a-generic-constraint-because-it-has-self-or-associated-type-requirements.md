This is a particularly confusing problem, and it occurs because SwiftUI relies heavily on opaque return types. The problem happens because of code like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: View {
        Text("SwiftUI")
    }
}
```

It feels like such a tiny thing, but the `body` property is declared as returning `View` rather than `some View`. The difference is small but important - you can find out more about it in my article [How to use opaque return types in Swift 5.1](https://hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-use-opaque-return-types-in-swift-5-1). <!-- NOTE: broken link -->

So, to fix the problem use this instead:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("SwiftUI")
  }
}
```
