> Updated for Xcode 15

When SwiftUI's `Text` views wrap across multiple lines, they align to their leading edge by default. If you want to change that, use the `multilineTextAlignment()` modifier to specify an alternative, such as `.center`, or `.trailing`.

For example, this will center several lines of text as they wrap across lines:

```swift
Text("This is an extremely long text string that will never fit even the widest of phones without wrapping")
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
    .frame(width: 300)
```

You can compare all three text alignments side by side using a picker such as this one:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let alignments: [TextAlignment] = [.leading, .center, .trailing]
    @State private var alignment = TextAlignment.leading

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Picker("Text alignment", selection: $alignment) {
                ForEach(alignments, id: \.self) { alignment in
                    Text(String(describing: alignment))
                }
            }

            Text("This is an extremely long text string that will never fit even the widest of phones without wrapping")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .multilineTextAlignment(alignment)
                .frame(width: 300)
        }
    }
}
```
