> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI gives us a dedicated property wrapper for working with Core Data fetch requests, and it allows us to embed data directly into SwiftUI views without having to write extra logic.

You must provide `@FetchRequest` with at least one value, which is an array of sort descriptors to arrange the data. You can optionally also provide a predicate to filter the data as needed.

::: important

Before using `@FetchRequest` you must first have injected a Core Data managed object context into the environment - see [how to access a Core Data managed object context from a SwiftUI view](/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-access-a-core-data-managed-object-context-from-a-swiftui-view.mdd) for instructions on how to do that.

:::

As a basic example, we could show all users from a Core Data context like this: 

```swift
@FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: []
) var users: FetchedResults<User>
```

That applies no sorting to the data, so the users will be returned in the order they were added. `@FetchRequest` automatically implies `@ObservedObject`, so if you use your data in a `List`, `ForEach`, or similar, it will automatically be refreshed when the underlying data changes.

::: tip

I’ve split the `@FetchRequest` code across several lines to make it easier to read, but it’s not required.

:::

If you want to sort your data, provide your sort descriptors as an array of key paths, like this: 

```swift
@FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: [
        SortDescriptor(\.name, order: .reverse)
    ]
) var users: FetchedResults<User>
```

You can provide as many as you want, and they will be evaluated in order.

To add a predicate as well, create an `NSPredicate` using your format like this:

```swift
@FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: [
        SortDescriptor(\.name, order: .reverse)
    ],
    predicate: NSPredicate(format: "surname == %@", "Hudson")
) var users: FetchedResults<User>
```
