> Updated for Xcode 16

**Improved in iOS 18**

SwiftUI’s `onScrollPhaseChange()` modifier lets us detect when the movement of a scrollview changes somehow.

For example, this changes a color from red to green whenever the user is actively interacting with it:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var backgroundColor = Color.red

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            backgroundColor
                .frame(height: 2000)
        }
        .onScrollPhaseChange { oldPhase, newPhase in
            if newPhase == .interacting {
                backgroundColor = .green
            } else {
                backgroundColor = .red
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The `oldPhase` and `newPhase` values can have one of five different values:

- `.animating`: When the scrollview is moving towards one particular view.
- `.decelerating`: When the user has released their finger and the scrollview is slowing down naturally.
- `.idle`: The scrollview is not moving or being interacted with.
- `.interacting`: The user has their finger down right now, either stationary or moving.
- `.tracking`: Used when the system thinks a user scroll event might be coming soon; I suspect this one isn't so helpful.

Having access to both the old and new values allows you to add subtle interactions - perhaps moving to idle after a drag triggers one result, whereas doing so after an animation triggers a different result.
