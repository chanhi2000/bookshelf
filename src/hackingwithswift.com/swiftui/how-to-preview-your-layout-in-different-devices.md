> Updated for Xcode 15

Xcode’s SwiftUI preview lets us show our designs in multiple screen sizes at the same time using the `.previewDevice()` modifier. This needs to be provided with the exact name of a device as seen in Xcode’s destination menu, e.g. “iPhone 14”.

For example, this shows a preview on the iPhone 14 Pro Max:

```swift
ContentView()
    .previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPhone 14 Pro Max"))
```

When using specific devices for previewing, you’re likely to find it useful to add in the `.previewDisplayName()` modifier, which lets you put a name under a device in the preview window.

For example, this creates two previews for two different devices, adding the name of each to make it clear what’s going on:

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
            .previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPhone 14"))
            .previewDisplayName("iPhone 14")

        ContentView()
            .previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: "iPhone 14 Pro Max"))
            .previewDisplayName("iPhone 14 Pro Max")
    }
}
```
