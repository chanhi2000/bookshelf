> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI's `badge()` modifier lets us add numbers and text to tab view items and list rows, with the purpose of drawing the user's attention to some supplementary status information - something like a number over a tab icon to represent an unread message count, for example.

For example, if you wanted to show the number 5 in red over a tab item, you would use this:

```swift
TabView {
    Text("Your home screen here")
        .tabItem {
            Label("Home", systemImage: "house")
        }
        .badge(5)
}
```

Badges work just as well with list rows, and automatically appear as right-aligned text in a secondary color. For example, we could make static list rows similar to the iOS Settings app like this:

```swift
List {
    Text("Wi-Fi")
        .badge("LAN Solo")

    Text("Bluetooth")
        .badge("On")
}
```
