SwiftUI apps launch using a custom struct that conforms to the `App` protocol, but sometimes you might want to get back the old `UIApplicationDelegate` functionality we used to have - perhaps to handle registration for push notifications, to respond to memory warnings, to detect time changes, and so on.

To do this, first create a custom class that inherits from `NSObject` and conforms to the `UIApplicationDelegate` protocol, like this:

```swift
class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey : Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        print("Your code here")
        return true
    }
}
```

I've added `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` in there, but you only need to implement the methods you care about.

And now in your `App` scene, use the `UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor` property wrapper to tell SwiftUI it should use your `AppDelegate` class for the application delegate.

```swift
@main
struct NewIn14App: App {
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI is responsible for creating that delegate and looking after its lifetime, so you can go ahead and add any other app delegate functionality to that class to have it called.

::: tip

For push notifications, you should probably adjust the `delegate` property of `UNUserNotificationCenter.current()` so that it points to a custom class you own.
