> Updated for Xcode 15

Although using `@Published` is the easiest way to control state updates, you can also do it by hand if you need something specific. For example, you might want the view to refresh only if you're happy with the values you've been given.

All observable objects automatically get access to an `objectWillChange` property, which itself has a `send()` method we can call whenever we want observing views to refresh.

For example:

```swift
// Create an observable object class that announces 
// changes to its only property
class UserAuthentication: ObservableObject {
    var username = "Taylor" {
        willSet {
            objectWillChange.send()
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    // Create an instance of our object
    @StateObject var user = UserAuthentication()

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            TextField("Enter your name", text: $user.username)
            Text("Your username is: \(user.username)")
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how we have a `willSet` property observer attached to the `username` property of `UserAuthentication`, allowing us to run code whenever that value changes. In our example code, we call `objectWillChange.send()` whenever `username` changes, which is what tells the `objectWillChange` publisher to put out the news that our data has changed so that any subscribed views can refresh.

::: tip

This example is no different from using `@Published` on the property, but now that we have a custom call to `objectWillChange.send()` we can add extra functionality – we could save the value to disk, for example.
