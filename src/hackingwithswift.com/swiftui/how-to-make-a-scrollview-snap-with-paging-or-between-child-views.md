**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI's `ScrollView` moves smoothly by default, but with the `scrollTargetLayout()` and `scrollTargetBehavior()` modifiers we can make it automatically snap to either to specific child views or to whole pages.

As an example, this places 10 rounded rectangles in a horizontal scroll view, with each one being a scroll target. Because `.scrollTargetBehavior()` is set to `.viewAligned`, SwiftUI will automatically snap between each of the rounded rectangles.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView(.horizontal) {
            LazyHStack {
                ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 25)
                        .fill(Color(hue: Double(i) / 10, saturation: 1, brightness: 1).gradient)
                        .frame(width: 300, height: 100)
                }
            }
            .scrollTargetLayout()
        }
        .scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)
        .safeAreaPadding(.horizontal, 40)
    }
}
```

That uses `scrollTargetLayout()` to make everything inside the layout be a scroll target. If you only want *some* child views to be snapped to, you should remove that and instead attach `scrollTarget()` to individual views.

An alternative scroll targeting behavior is `.paging`, which makes the `ScrollView` move by exactly one screen width or height depending on your scroll direction:

```swift
ScrollView {
    ForEach(0..<50) { i in
        Text("Item \(i)")
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
            .frame(height: 200)
            .background(.blue)
            .foregroundStyle(.white)
            .clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius: 20))
    }
}
.scrollTargetBehavior(.paging)
```
