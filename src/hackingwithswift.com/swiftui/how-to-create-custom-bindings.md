When we use SwiftUI's `@State` property wrapper it does a huge amount of work on our behalf to allow two-way bindings for user interface controls. However, we can also create bindings by hand using the `Binding` type, which can be provided with custom `get` and `set` closures to run when the value is read or written.

For example, this creates a trivial binding that just acts as a passthrough for another property:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username = ""

    var body: some View {
        let binding = Binding(
            get: { self.username },
            set: { self.username = $0 }
        )

        return VStack {
            TextField("Enter your name", text: binding)
        }
    }
}
```

::: tip

When binding to a custom `Binding` instance, you don't need to use the dollar sign before the binding name - you're already reading the two-way binding.

:::

Custom bindings are useful when you want to add extra logic to a binding being read or written - you might want to perform some calculations before sending a value back, or you might want to take some extra actions when the value is changed.

For example, we could create a stack of two toggle switches where both can be off and either one can be on, but both can't be on at the same time - enabling one will always disable the other. Here's how that looks in code:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var firstToggle = false
    @State private var secondToggle = false

    var body: some View {
        let firstBinding = Binding(
            get: { self.firstToggle },
            set: {
                self.firstToggle = $0

                if $0 == true {
                    self.secondToggle = false
                }
            }
        )

        let secondBinding = Binding(
            get: { self.secondToggle },
            set: {
                self.secondToggle = $0

                if $0 == true {
                    self.firstToggle = false
                }
            }
        )

        return VStack {
            Toggle(isOn: firstBinding) {
                Text("First toggle")
            }

            Toggle(isOn: secondBinding) {
                Text("Second toggle")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
