> Updated for Xcode 15

When using observed objects there are three key things we need to work with: the `ObservableObject` protocol is used with some sort of class that can store data, the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper is used inside a view to store an observable object instance, and the `@Published` property wrapper is added to any properties inside an observed object that should cause views to update when they change.

::: tip

It is really important that you use `@ObservedObject` only with views that were passed in from elsewhere. You should *not* use this property wrapper to create the initial instance of an observable object - that's what `@StateObject` is for.

:::

As an example, here's a `UserProgress` class that conforms to `ObservableObject`:

```swift
class UserProgress: ObservableObject {
    @Published var score = 0
}
```

I know that doesn't look like much code, but that's because SwiftUI is doing a remarkable amount on our behalf! There are two things that matter in there:

1. The `ObservableObject` conformance allows instances of this class to be used inside views, so that when important changes happen the view will reload.
2. The `@Published` property wrapper tells SwiftUI that changes to `score` should trigger view reloads.

We can use that `UserProgress` class with code like this:

```swift
class UserProgress: ObservableObject {
    @Published var score = 0
}

struct InnerView: View {
    @ObservedObject var progress: UserProgress

    var body: some View {
        Button("Increase Score") {
            progress.score += 1
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var progress = UserProgress()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Your score is \(progress.score)")
            InnerView(progress: progress)
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, other than using the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper with `progress`, everything else more or less looks the same - SwiftUI takes care of all the implementation details for us.

There is *one* important difference, though: the `progress` property isn't declared as private. This is because bound objects can be used by more than one view, so it's common to share it openly.

Remember, please do *not* use `@ObservedObject` to create instances of your object. If that's what you want to do, use `@StateObject` instead.
