SwiftUI makes it relatively easy to show a single alert, but things become trickier if you try to show two or more alerts from a single view – you might find that one alert works and the other doesn’t, for example.

To solve this, you need to make sure you attach no more than one `alert()` modifier to each view. That might sound limiting, but remember: you don’t need to attach the alerts to the *same* view – you can attach them anywhere. In fact, you might find that attaching them directly to the thing that shows them (e.g. a button) works best for you.

As an example, we can write some code to define two `@State` properties that each control an alert being shown. Rather than attaching both `alert()` modifiers to the same `VStack`, this attaches them each to whichever button is responsible for showing that alert:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingAlert1 = false
    @State private var showingAlert2 = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Show 1") {
                showingAlert1 = true
            }
            .alert(isPresented: $showingAlert1) {
                Alert(title: Text("One"), message: nil, dismissButton: .cancel())
            }

            Button("Show 2") {
                showingAlert2 = true
            }
            .alert(isPresented: $showingAlert2) {
                Alert(title: Text("Two"), message: nil, dismissButton: .cancel())
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you try moving both `alert()` modifiers to the `VStack`, you’ll find that only one works, which is why the above approach is so useful.
