Everything in this guide is designed to help you solve hands-on, practical problems with your SwiftUI code, and it focuses specifically on helping you write SwiftUI projects effectively. But if you want to really extend your skills – if you want to understand how SwiftUI works behind the scenes, if you want to tackle more advanced techniques that help you deliver the best apps around, and if you want to learn how to identify and resolve even difficult performance problems, I have a whole other book for you: Pro SwiftUI.

Pro SwiftUI is aimed at developers who are already feeling comfortable with building SwiftUI apps, but who want to take their knowledge to the next level. It’s a book, yes, but it also includes over 7 hours of videos demonstrating all the techniques in action.

While following along, you'll learn all this and more:

- How SwiftUI uses parents and children to create its layouts
- Taking advantage of layout neutrality to get exactly the layout you want
- How TupleView and ViewBuilder combine to clean up your code
- Making the most of structural and explicit identity
- Creating advanced animations – even for things that don't seem animatable
- Overriding explicit and implicit animations
- Building complex view transitions that go way beyond Apple's built-in options
- Creating custom environment keys
- Leveraging view preferences for two-way communication
- Creating custom view layouts, including radial layouts and masonry
- Designing gorgeous visual effects such as particle systems, metaballs, lava effects, and even fragment shaders
- Maximising your app's performance by identifying and resolving hot spots

This book is simply packed with tools, tips, and tricks to help you develop a thorough understanding of how SwiftUI works, so you can write more confidently, build more complex apps, and take advantage of its power.
