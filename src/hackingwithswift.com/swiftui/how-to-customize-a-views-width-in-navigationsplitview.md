> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `NavigationSplitView` uses a system-standard width for the view it presents, but with the `navigationSplitViewColumnWidth()` modifier you can attempt to customize this.

::: note

The system can choose to ignore the width you specify. At the time of writing this modifier is ignored on iPhone, and on iPad only works for values *lower* than the default size.

:::

In its simplest form, sending a single value to `navigationSplitViewColumnWidth()` causes it to use a fixed size, no smaller or larger:

```swift
NavigationSplitView {
    Text("Sidebar")
        .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(100)
} content: {
   Text("Content")
        .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(200)
} detail: {
    Text("Detail")
}
```

However, if you're happy to allow flexibility – and if you're platform supports it, which right now might just be macOS – you an provide minimum, ideal, and maximum sizes instead, like this:

```swift
NavigationSplitView {
    Text("Sidebar")
        .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min: 100, ideal: 200, max: 300)
} content: {
   Text("Content")
        .navigationSplitViewColumnWidth(min: 100, ideal: 200, max: 300)
} detail: {
    Text("Detail")
}
```
