> Updated for Xcode 15

watchOS has a particularly common list style that can easily be replicated using `List`: rows in the list slide and scale up when they are moving onto the screen, then slide and and scale *down* when they are moving *off* the screen. This is particularly effective with chunkier, graphical rows – it’s almost like Apple’s old Cover Flow effect.

To enable this carousel effect, use the `.listStyle()` modifier with `.carousel`, like this:

```swift
List(1..<51) {
    Text("\($0)")
}
.listStyle(.carousel)
```

::: important

If you’re using Xcode 12 you need to use `CarouselListStyle()` rather than `.carousel`.

::: note

this is available only on watchOS.
