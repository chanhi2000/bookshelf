> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated for iOS 15**

SwiftUI's `Picker` can also be used to create segmented controls equivalent to `UISegmentedControl` from UIKit, although it needs to be bound to some state and you must ensure to give each segment a tag so it can be identified. Segments can be text or pictures; anything else will silently fail.

As an example, this creates a segmented control that works with a `favoriteColor` state property, and adds a text view below that shows whichever value was selected:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var favoriteColor = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Picker("What is your favorite color?", selection: $favoriteColor) {
                Text("Red").tag(0)
                Text("Green").tag(1)
                Text("Blue").tag(2)
            }
            .pickerStyle(.segmented)

            Text("Value: \(favoriteColor)")
        }
    }
}
```

::: important

If you're using Xcode 12 you need to use `SegmentedPickerStyle()` rather than `.segmented`.

:::

In this instance, though, it's better to create an array to store the various colors, then use `ForEach` to create the text view inside using a loop:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var favoriteColor = "Red"
    var colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Picker("What is your favorite color?", selection: $favoriteColor) {
                ForEach(colors, id: \.self) {
                    Text($0)
                }
            }
            .pickerStyle(.segmented)

            Text("Value: \(favoriteColor)")
        }
    }
}
```
