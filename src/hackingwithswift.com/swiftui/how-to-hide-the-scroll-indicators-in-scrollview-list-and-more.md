> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 16**

SwiftUI's `scrollIndicators()` modifier allows us to determine whether to show the scroll indicators or not - those are the little flashing bars that both give the user a sense of the size of our content, but also allows for a long press scroll.

Use it like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List(1..<100) { i in
            Text("Row \(i)")
        }
        .scrollIndicators(.hidden)
    }
}
```

There are four options available to us, and there are subtle distinctions:

1. The default is `.automatic`, which is what you'd get without the modifier in place - SwiftUI will do whatever it thinks is best.
2. Specify `.visible` to get auto-hiding indicators on iOS, or to respect whatever is the user's preference on macOS.
3. Use `.hidden` to hide the indicators on iOS, and *mostly* hide them on macOS too - if the user connects a mouse, the scroll indicators will return.
4. Use `.never` to hide the indicators on iOS and also on macOS, regardless of what pointing device user has.
