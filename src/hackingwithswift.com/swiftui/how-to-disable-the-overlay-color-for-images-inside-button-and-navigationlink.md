> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated in iOS 15**

On iOS, an image drawn inside a `NavigationLink` or a `Button` will almost certainly not behave as you expect: the whole image will be be covered with an opaque blue color, or whatever accent color you have in your view.

There are two ways you can fix this; which you choose depends on the behavior you want.

First, you can use the `renderingMode()` mode modifier to achieve a slightly different result:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    NavigationLink {
        Text("Detail view here")
    } label: {
        Image("logo")
            .renderingMode(.original)
    }
}
```

As an alternative, you can use the `buttonStyle()` modifier with `.plain`, like this:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    NavigationLink {
        Text("Detail view here")
    } label: {
        Image("logo")
    }
    .buttonStyle(.plain)
}
```

Or like this for plain buttons:

```swift
Button {
    // your action here
} label: {
    Image("logo")
}
.buttonStyle(.plain)
```

::: important

If you're using Xcode 12 you need to use `PlainButtonStyle()` rather than `.plain`.

:::

The difference is subtle, but important: if you use a `Button` inside a `List`, using `buttonStyle(.plain)` will mean that only the space directly around the button's content can be tapped, whereas if you use `.renderingMode(.original)` then the whole cell remains tappable.
