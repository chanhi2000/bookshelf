> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's text views come with two specific date formatters to make dates look better on screen: one to handle single dates, and one to handle date ranges.

The date range version is actually simpler, because you just provide a closed date range and it will make sure it's formatted appropriately according to the user's locale:

```swift
Text(Date.now...Date.now.addingTimeInterval(600))
```

The text “2:37–2:47 PM”

For example, that might show “10:30AM-10:40AM”.

When working with single dates, you should provide a `style` parameter to accompany it to determine how the date should be formatted. Here are some options:

```swift
VStack {
    // show just the date
    Text(Date.now.addingTimeInterval(600), style: .date)

    // show just the time
    Text(Date.now.addingTimeInterval(600), style: .time)

    // show the relative distance from now, automatically updating
    Text(Date.now.addingTimeInterval(600), style: .relative)

    // make a timer style, automatically updating
    Text(Date.now.addingTimeInterval(600), style: .timer)
}
```
