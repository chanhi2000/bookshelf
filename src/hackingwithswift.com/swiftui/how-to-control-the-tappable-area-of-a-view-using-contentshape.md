> Updated for Xcode 15

If you add a tap gesture to a primitive SwiftUI view such as `Text` or `Image`, the whole view becomes tappable. If you add a tap gesture to a container SwiftUI view, such as `VStack` or `HStack`, then SwiftUI only adds the gesture to the parts of the container that have something inside - large parts of the stack are likely to be untappable.

If this is what you want then the default behavior is fine. However, if you want to change the shape of hit tests - the area that responds to taps - then you should use the `contentShape()` modifier with the shape you want.

For example, this code creates a `VStack` containing an image, a spacer, and some text, then uses the `contentShape()` modifier to make the whole stack tappable rather than just the image and text:

```swift
VStack {
    Image(systemName: "person.circle").resizable().frame(width: 50, height: 50)
    Spacer().frame(height: 50)
    Text("Paul Hudson")
}
.contentShape(Rectangle())
.onTapGesture {
    print("Show details for user")
}
```
