> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI doesn't have a built-in way to detect the user shaking their device, but it doesn't take much work to create one yourself by overriding `motionEnded()` in `UIWindow` and creating a custom view modifier.

This takes five steps:

1. Adding an extension to `UIDevice` to track a new notification that will be sent when a shake gesture happens.
2. Create an extension on `UIWindow` to override the default `motionEnded()` method. This is where UIKit sends shake gestures, so you should look for that happening and translate it into your new notification.
3. Create a custom view modifier to watch for the shake notification being posted, and call a function of your choosing when it happens.
4. Create a `View` extension that wraps up your new modifier neatly.
5. Try it out in a view.

::: important

At the time of writing view modifiers do *not* work with `onReceive()` unless you first add `onAppear()`, which is why it appears above. Yes, it's empty, but it acts as a workaround for the problem.

Here's a complete code sample walking through all five steps with comments:

```swift
// The notification we'll send when a shake gesture happens.
extension UIDevice {
    static let deviceDidShakeNotification = Notification.Name(rawValue: "deviceDidShakeNotification")
}

//  Override the default behavior of shake gestures to send our notification instead.
extension UIWindow {
     open override func motionEnded(_ motion: UIEvent.EventSubtype, with event: UIEvent?) {
        if motion == .motionShake {
            NotificationCenter.default.post(name: UIDevice.deviceDidShakeNotification, object: nil)
        }
     }
}

// A view modifier that detects shaking and calls a function of our choosing.
struct DeviceShakeViewModifier: ViewModifier {
    let action: () -> Void

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .onAppear()
            .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UIDevice.deviceDidShakeNotification)) { _ in
                action()
            }
    }
}

// A View extension to make the modifier easier to use.
extension View {
    func onShake(perform action: @escaping () -> Void) -> some View {
        self.modifier(DeviceShakeViewModifier(action: action))
    }
}

// An example view that responds to being shaken
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Shake me!")
            .onShake {
                print("Device shaken!")
            }
    }
}
```

As you can see, once you have the first four steps in place you can go ahead and add an `onShake()` modifier to any view you want, providing some custom code to run when the shake gesture happens – it's not straightforward to set up, but once you're done it all works neatly.
