> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI has a dedicated `listItemTint()` modifier that controls how the list colors its rows. The exact behavior depends on which platform your app is running on, but the code is the same. For example, this will tint even rows red and odd rows green:

```swift
List(1..<51) { i in
    Label("Row \(i)", systemImage: "\(i).circle")
        .listItemTint(i.isMultiple(of: 2) ? .red : .green)
}
```

Like I said, exactly what that does depends on the platform:

- On iOS that will change the icons to be red and green, but leave the text in its primary color.
- On macOS that will also change the icons to be red and green, overriding the user's preferred accent color.
- On watchOS that will change the row background color (known as its “background platter”) to be red or green.
- On tvOS it will do nothing at all.

On macOS, you can respect the user's accent color while also adding your own *preferred* list row tint like this:

```swift
List(1..<51) { i in
    Label("Row \(i)", systemImage: "\(i).circle")
        .listItemTint(.preferred(i.isMultiple(of: 2) ? .red : .green))
}
```

That will now apply the user's selected accent color if they have one, but if they have the Multicolor accent set then the rows will be tinted red or green as before.
