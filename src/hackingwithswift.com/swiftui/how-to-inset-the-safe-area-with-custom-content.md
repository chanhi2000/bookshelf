> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI provides a `safeAreaInset()` modifier that lets us place content outside the device's safe area, while also having other views adjust their layout so their content remains visible - it effectively shrinks the safe area to ensure all content can be seen as intended. This is different from `ignoresSafeArea()`, which merely extends a view's edges so they go edge to edge.

For example, a list would normally scroll to the very end of the screen, but we could place something outside the safe area at the bottom and have the list automatically adjust its insets so all its contents are visible when we scroll to its end:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    List(0..<100) { i in
        Text("Row \(i)")
    }
    .navigationTitle("Select a row")
    .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom) {
        Text("Outside Safe Area")
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .foregroundStyle(.white)
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
            .padding()
            .background(.indigo)
    }
}
```

::: important

Before iOS 15.2 this worked only with `ScrollView`, but from 15.2 and later this also works with `List` and `Form`.

:::

If you need extra space between your content and the safe area inset content, add a spacing parameter like this: `.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom, spacing: 20)`.

You can also add an *alignment* to your safe area inset content, which is useful for times when it doesn't take up the full amount of available space. For example, we could place an information button in the bottom trailing corner like this:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    List(0..<100) { i in
        Text("Row \(i)")
    }
    .navigationTitle("Select a row")
    .safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom, alignment: .trailing) {
        Button {
            print("Show help")
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "info.circle.fill")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .symbolRenderingMode(.multicolor)
                .padding(.trailing)
        }
        .accessibilityLabel("Show help")
    }
}
```

::: tip

You can apply `safeAreaInset()` multiple times if needed, and each inset will take into account the previous insets.
