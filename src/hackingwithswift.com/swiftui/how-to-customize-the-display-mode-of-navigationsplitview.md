> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `NavigationSplitView` has three options to control how sidebars are displayed, each of which can be adjusted using the `navigationSplitViewStyle()` modifier.

The first is `.prominentDetail`, which tells SwiftUI you want the detail view to retain its full size at all times - the sidebar and content view will *slide over* the detail view, rather than pushing it to one side or squeezing it smaller:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView {
            Text("Sidebar")
        } content: {
            Text("Content")
        } detail: {
            Text("Detail")
        }
        .navigationSplitViewStyle(.prominentDetail)
    }
}
```

The second option is `.balanced`, which will reduce the size of your detail view as the sidebar or content bar are shown - just switch `.prominentDetail` to `.balanced`, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView {
            Text("Sidebar")
        } content: {
            Text("Content")
        } detail: {
            Text("Detail")
        }
        .navigationSplitViewStyle(.balanced)
    }
}
```

The default is `.automatic`, which will vary according to the platform - at the time of writing, on iPhone it becomes `prominentDetail`, and on iPad it becomes `.balanced`.
