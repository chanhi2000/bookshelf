When using `NavigationSplitView` on macOS and iPadOS, SwiftUI lets us toggle showing the sidebar, content view, and detail view using the `NavigationSplitViewVisibility` enum. 

This code sample shows all three variations:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var columnVisibility = NavigationSplitViewVisibility.detailOnly

    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView(columnVisibility: $columnVisibility) {
            Text("Sidebar")
        } content: {
           Text("Content")
        } detail: {
            VStack {
                Button("Detail Only") {
                    columnVisibility = .detailOnly
                }

                Button("Content and Detail") {
                    columnVisibility = .doubleColumn
                }

                Button("Show All") {
                    columnVisibility = .all
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There are four modes to choose from:

- In `.detailOnly` mode, the detail view will take up all the available screen space for your app.
- In `.doubleColumn` mode, you'll see both the content and detail views.
- In `.all` mode, the system will attempt to show all three views if they exist. In the case where you don't have a content view (the middle view), it will only show two.
- In `.automatic` mode, the system will do what it thinks is best based on the current device and orientation.

::: note

providing the `columnVisibility` is done using a binding because your value will automatically be updated as the user interacts with your UI.

:::

Although SwiftUI uses different names for these three parts of our split view interface, they match up directly with UIKit counterparts: the sidebar is “primary” in UIKit, content is “supplementary”, and detail is “secondary”.
