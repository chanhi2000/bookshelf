> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI has built-in support for rendering Markdown, including bold, italic, links, and more. It's literally built right into SwiftUI's `Text` view, so you can write code like this:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("This is regular text.")
    Text("* This is **bold** text, this is *italic* text, and this is ***bold, italic*** text.")
    Text("~~A strikethrough example~~")
    Text("`Monospaced works too`")
    Text("Visit Apple: [click here](https://apple.com)")
}
```

Several lines of text appropriately formatted with Markdown styling.

And yes, that link is automatically tappable. Markdown links will use your app's accent color by default, but you can change that using the `tint()` modifier:

```swift
Text("Visit Apple: [click here](https://apple.com)")
    .tint(.indigo)
```

::: note

Images aren't supported.

This automatic Markdown conversion happens because SwiftUI interprets those strings as being instances of `LocalizedStringKey` – strings that can be localized by our app. This means if you want to create Markdown text from a property or variable, you should mark it explicitly as being `LocalizedStringKey` to get the Markdown rendering:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let markdownText: LocalizedStringKey = "* This is **bold** text, this is *italic* text, and this is ***bold, italic*** text."

    var body: some View {
        Text(markdownText)
    }
}
```

If you wanted the original text unchanged – i.e., you wanted the raw, unformatted Markdown symbols to be left in place – just remove the `LocalizedStringKey` annotation. Alternatively, you can disable both Markdown and localization entirely using the `Text(verbatim:)` initializer.
