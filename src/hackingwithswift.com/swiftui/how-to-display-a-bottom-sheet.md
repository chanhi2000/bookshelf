**New in iOS 16**

SwiftUI’s `presentationDetents()` modifier lets us create sheets that slide up from the bottom of our view, but occupy only part of the screen – how much is down to us, and we have as much or as little control as we want.

To use the modifier, provide it with a set of the sizes you want to support, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingCredits = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Credits") {
            showingCredits.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingCredits) {
            Text("This app was brought to you by Hacking with Swift")
                .presentationDetents([.medium, .large])
        }
    }
}
```

By supporting both `.medium` (about half the screen) and `.large` (all the screen), SwiftUI will create a resize handle to let the user adjust the sheet between those two sizes. If you don’t want that, add `presentationDragIndicator(.hidden)` to the contents of your sheet, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingCredits = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Credits") {
            showingCredits.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingCredits) {
            Text("This app was brought to you by Hacking with Swift")
                .presentationDetents([.medium, .large])
                .presentationDragIndicator(.hidden)
        }
    }
}
```

::: tip

If you don’t ask for any detent, the default is `.large`.

Be careful: Even with custom presentation detents in place, sheets will automatically take up the full screen when there’s a compact height size class – an iPhone in landscape, for example. Make sure you provide a way to dismiss your sheet if you support this scenario.

As well as specifying one of the built-in sizes, you can also provide a custom fraction in the range of 0 through 1. For example, this creates a sheet taking up the bottom 15% of the screen:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingCredits = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Credits") {
            showingCredits.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingCredits) {
            Text("This app was brought to you by Hacking with Swift")
                .presentationDetents([.fraction(0.15)])
        }
    }
}
```

Or you can specify an exact point height like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingCredits = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Credits") {
            showingCredits.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingCredits) {
            Text("This app was brought to you by Hacking with Swift")
                .presentationDetents([.height(300)])
        }
    }
}
```

You can attach as many detents to your views as you need – just add them all to the set of detents, and SwiftUI will take care of the rest. For example, this lets the user go between 10% and 100% in 10% steps:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingCredits = false

    let heights = stride(from: 0.1, through: 1.0, by: 0.1).map { PresentationDetent.fraction($0) }

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Credits") {
            showingCredits.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingCredits) {
            Text("This app was brought to you by Hacking with Swift")
                .presentationDetents(Set(heights))
        }
    }
}
```
