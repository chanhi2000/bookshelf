SwiftUI requires that we add labels to its controls, and it's common to want to hide those labels so you can get a more precise UI layout. However, there's a *bad* way of hiding labels and a *good* way, and it's already common to see folks choosing the bad choice despite it actively hurting users.

First, let's look at the *  * way to hide labels. As an example, here's a Picker that lets users select a number:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedNumber = 0

    var body: some View {
        Picker("Select a number", selection: $selectedNumber) {
            ForEach(0..<10) {
                Text("\($0)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

On some platforms, that will show “Select a number” alongside the picker. This can look poor, because the label is sometimes crammed into a small space - a better idea would be to have a `VStack` with a custom text label, then hide the label in the `Picker`.

To hide the label for a `Picker` - or indeed for a `DatePicker`, a `Stepper`, a `Toggle`, or any other view that requires a label - you should add the `labelsHidden()` modifier to the view, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedNumber = 0

    var body: some View {
        Picker("Select a number", selection: $selectedNumber) {
            ForEach(0..<10) {
                Text("\($0)")
            }
        }
        .labelsHidden()        
    }
}
```

![A wheel-style picker offering the numbers 0, 1, 2, etc. 0 is selected.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-hide-the-label-of-a-picker-stepper-toggle-and-more-using-labelshidden-1~dark.png)

That still creates the label, but now it doesn't get shown no matter what platform is used. As a result, you can put the `Picker` inside a `VStack` and add a label of your own choosing.

::: tip

If you want *all* your labels hidden you can apply the `labelsHidden()` modifier to a `VStack` or whatever you're using as your outermost container.

:::

In case you were curious, the *wrong* way to hide labels is using `EmptyView`, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedNumber = 0

    var body: some View {
        Picker(selection: $selectedNumber, label: EmptyView()) {
            ForEach(0..<10) {
                Text("\($0)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Yes, the end result might *look* the same, but there's an important reason why using `labelsHidden()` is much better: the hidden label is still accessible by the screen reader, so even though the text isn't visible it's still there to help VoiceOver understand how your UI is structured.
