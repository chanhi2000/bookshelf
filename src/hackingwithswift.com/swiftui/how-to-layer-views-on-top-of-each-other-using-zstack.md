SwiftUI has a dedicated stack type for creating overlapping content, which is useful if you want to place some text over a picture for example. It's called `ZStack`, and it works identically to the other two stack types.

For example, we could place a large image underneath some text like this:

```swift
ZStack {
    Image("niagara-falls")
    Text("Hacking with Swift")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .background(.black)
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
}
```

Like the other stack types, `ZStack` can be created with an alignment so that it doesn't always center things inside itself:

```swift
ZStack(alignment: .leading) {
    Image("niagara-falls")
    Text("Hacking with Swift")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .background(.black)
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
}
```

However, it doesn't have a spacing property because it doesn't make sense. Instead, you should use the `offset()` modifier as shown in [How to adjust the position of a view using its offset](/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-adjust-the-position-of-a-view-using-its-offset.md).
