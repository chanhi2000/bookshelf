> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI allows up to 10 static children in each container, so if you try to add 11 or more you’ll get this error. To be clear, this means the following code is valid:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
    Text("SwiftUI")
}
```

But if you add a single more `Text("SwiftUI")` then the code will refuse to build.

To fix this problem, wrap your items in groups of 10 or fewer, like this:

```swift
VStack {
    Group {
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
    }

    Group {
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
        Text("SwiftUI")
    }
}
```
