> Updated for Xcode 16

**Updated for iOS 15**

SwiftUI's forms work as containers, just like `HStack` and `VStack`, which means you can add other views inside them as needed. However, they automatically adapt the behavior and styling of some controls so they fit better in the form environment.

For example, this creates a form with a toggle, a segmented control, and a button:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var enableLogging = false
    @State private var selectedColor = "Red"
    @State private var colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            Picker("Select a color", selection: $selectedColor) {
                ForEach(colors, id: \.self) {
                    Text($0)
                }
            }
            .pickerStyle(.segmented)

            Toggle("Enable Logging", isOn: $enableLogging)

            Button("Save changes") {
                // activate theme!
            }
        }
    }
}
```

::: important

If you're using Xcode 12 you need to use `SegmentedPickerStyle()` rather than `.segmented`.

:::

When that code is run you'll see two things that are fundamental to the behavior of forms:

- On iOS the form automatically adopts the style of a grouped list, so users see a scrolling selection of options.
- The button has adapted itself to look like an actionable list row – it's left-aligned and in blue.

You can have as many rows in your form as you need, but remember to use `Group` if you need more than 10.
