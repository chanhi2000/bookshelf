> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI's `ScrollView` starts scrolling from the top by default, but if you want to create a UI like Apple's Messages app you can ask the scroll view to start at the bottom by using the `scrollPosition()` modifier with an initial anchor of `.bottom`.

For example, this shows 50 text views in a scroll view, but asks the scroll view to start its position from the bottom rather than the top:

```swift
ScrollView {
    ForEach(0..<50) { i in
        Text("Item \(i)")
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
            .padding()
            .background(.blue)
            .clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius: 25))
    }
}
.scrollPosition(initialAnchor: .bottom)
```

If your UI alters somehow without the user scrolling – for example if the keyboard appears, or you adjust the size of the scroll view – then the scroll position will remain anchored to the bottom. However, if the user adjusts the scroll position manually, it will scroll freely as normal.

::: tip

The `initialAnchor` parameter is any `UnitPoint`, so you can use `.trailing` to start a horizontal scroll view from the right edge, or any exact value you need for your UI.
