This was a huge project, and gave you lots to learn about mixing UIKit and SpriteKit, texture atlases, scene transitions, and of course destructible terrain - while also giving you another real-world project under your belt.

This project should also have shown you how you can bring skills together to make something bigger and better: Core Graphics and physics combined to make destructible terrain, and really it wasn’t that hard!

## Review what you learned

Anyone can sit through a tutorial, but it takes actual work to remember what was taught. It’s my job to make sure you take as much from these tutorials as possible, so I’ve prepared a short review to help you check your learning.

## Challenge

One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.
2. Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless of which iPad size is used.
3. Use the physics world’s gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the direction and strength.
