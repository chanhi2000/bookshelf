## Need help?

I put together answers for over 600 of the most frequently asked questions I received from readers into one place: [the Swift 5 Knowledge Base](/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/README.md). It answers basic and advanced questions, and provides lots of free code you can re-use however you please. If you hit problems, try searching there first.

If you're still having problems, you can post to the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-reddit"/>Hacking with Swift subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/hackingwithswift) where you can expect an answer fairly quickly, or you can [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"/>find me on Twitter](http://x.com/twostraws) where I'll do my best to help.
