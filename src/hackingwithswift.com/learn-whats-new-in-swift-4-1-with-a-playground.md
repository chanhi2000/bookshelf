Previously I wrote about [the new features in Swift 4.1](/hackingwithswift.com/whats-new-in-swift-4-1.md), but it's a lot more fun to see things in action and experiment yourself.

So, I just released an Xcode playground that demonstrates the new features introduced in Swift 4.1, complete with examples that I hope make them easy to understand and apply in your own work:

- Synthesized `Equatable` and `Hashable`
- Key decoding strategy in `Codable`
- Conditional conformances
- Recursive constraints on associated types
- Build configuration import testing
- Target environment testing
- `flatMap()` is now (partly) `compactMap()`

::: info

The playground is available on GitHub, so I hope you'll try it for yourself:

:::

I should add that the task of building this playground was made much easier thanks to previous work done by [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"/>Ole Begemann](https://x.com/olebegemann).
