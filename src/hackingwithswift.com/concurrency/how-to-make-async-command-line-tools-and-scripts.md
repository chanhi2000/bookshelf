> Updated for Xcode 15

If you’re writing a command-line tool, you can use `async` in conjunction with the `@main` attribute to launch your app into an async context immediately. To do this, first create the static `main()` method as you normally would with `@main`, then add `async` to it. You can optionally also add `throws` if you don’t intend to handle errors there.

For example, we could write a small command-line tool that fetches data from a URL and prints it out:

```swift
@main
struct UserFetcher {
    static func main() async throws {
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/users.csv")!

        for try await line in url.lines {
            print("Received user: \(line)")
        }
    }
}
```

::: tip

Just like using the `@main` attribute with a synchronous `main()` method, you should not include a <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift` file in your command-line project.

:::

Using `async` and `@main` together benefits from the full range of Swift concurrency features. Behind the scenes, Swift will automatically create a new task in which it runs your `main()` method, then terminate the program when that task finishes.

Although it doesn’t work in the current Xcode release, the goal is for Swift to support async calls in top-level code. This would mean you could use <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift` files and remove most of the code in the previous sample - you could just go ahead and make async calls outside of a function.
