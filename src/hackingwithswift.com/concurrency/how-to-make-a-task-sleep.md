Swift’s `Task` struct has a static `sleep()` method that will cause the current task to be suspended for at least some number of nanoseconds. Yes, nanoseconds: you need to write 1_000_000_000 to get 1 second. You need to call `Task.sleep()` using `await` as it will cause the task to be suspended, and you also need to use `try` because `sleep()` will throw an error if the task is cancelled.

For example, this will make the current task sleep for at least 3 seconds:

```swift
try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 3_000_000_000)
```

::: important

Calling `Task.sleep()` will make the current task sleep for *at least* the amount of time you ask, not *exactly* the time you ask. There is a little drift involved because the system might be busy doing other work when the sleep ends, but you are at least guaranteed it won’t end *before* your time has elapsed.

:::

Using nanoseconds is a bit clumsy, but Swift doesn’t have an alternative at this time - the plan seems to be to wait for a more thorough review of managing time in the language before committing to specific API.

In the meantime, we can add small `Task` extensions to make sleeping easier to accomplish. For example, this lets us sleep using seconds as a floating-point number:

```swift
extension Task where Success == Never, Failure == Never {
    static func sleep(seconds: Double) async throws {
        let duration = UInt64(seconds * 1_000_000_000)
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: duration)
    }
}
```

With that in place, you can now write `Task.sleep(seconds: 0.5)` or similar.

Calling `Task.sleep()` automatically checks for cancellation, meaning that if you cancel a sleeping task it will be woken and throw a `CancellationError` for you to catch.

::: tip

Unlike making a thread sleep, `Task.sleep()` does *not* block the underlying thread, allowing it pick up work from elsewhere if needed.
