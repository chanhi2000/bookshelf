All methods and mutable properties inside an actor are isolated to that actor by default, which means they cannot be accessed directly from code that’s external to the actor. Access to constant properties is automatically allowed because they are inherently safe from race conditions, but if you want you can make some methods excepted by using the `nonisolated` keyword.

Actor methods that are non-isolated can access other non-isolated state, such as constant properties or other methods that are marked non-isolated. However, they *cannot* directly access *isolated state* like an isolated actor method would; they need to use `await` instead.

To demonstrate non-isolated methods, we could write a `User` actor that has three properties: two constant strings for their username and password, and a variable Boolean to track whether they are online. Because `password` is constant, we could write a non-isolated method that returns the hash of that password using CryptoKit, like this:

```swift
import CryptoKit
import Foundation

actor User {
    let username: String
    let password: String
    var isOnline = false

    init(username: String, password: String) {
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
    }

    nonisolated func passwordHash() -> String {
        let passwordData = Data(password.utf8)
        let hash = SHA256.hash(data: passwordData)
        return hash.compactMap { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
    }
}

let user = User(username: "twostraws", password: "s3kr1t")
print(user.passwordHash())
```

I’d like to pick out a handful of things in that code:

1. Marking `passwordHash()` as `nonisolated` means that we can call it externally without using `await`.
2. We can also use `nonisolated` with computed properties, which in the previous example would have made `nonisolated var passwordHash: String`. Stored properties may not be non-isolated.
3. Non-isolated properties and methods can access only other non-isolated properties and methods, which in our case is a constant property. Swift will not let you ignore this rule.

Non-isolated methods are particularly useful when dealing with protocol conformances such as `Hashable` and `Codable`, where we must implement methods to be run from outside the actor. 

For example, if we wanted to make our `User` actor conform to `Codable`, we’d need to implement `encode(to:)` ourselves as a non-isolated method like this:

```swift
actor User: Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: CodingKey {
        case username, password
    }

    let username: String
    let password: String
    var isOnline = false

    init(username: String, password: String) {
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
    }

    nonisolated func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(username, forKey: .username)
        try container.encode(password, forKey: .password)
    }
}

let user = User(username: "twostraws", password: "s3kr1t")

if let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(user) {
    let json = String(decoding: encoded, as: UTF8.self)
    print(json)
}
```
