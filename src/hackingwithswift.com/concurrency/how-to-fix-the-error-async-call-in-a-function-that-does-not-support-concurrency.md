> Updated for Xcode 15

This error occurs when you’ve tried to call an async function from a synchronous function, which is not allowed in Swift - asynchronous functions must be able to suspend themselves and their callers, and synchronous functions simply don’t know how to do that.

If your asynchronous work needs to be waited for, you don’t have much of a choice but to mark your current code as also being `async` so that you can use `await` as normal. However, sometimes this can result in a bit of an “async infection” - you mark one function as being async, which means its caller needs to be async too, as does *`its*` caller, and so on, until you’ve turned one error into 50.

In this situation, you can create a dedicated `Task` to solve the problem. We’ll be covering this API in more detail later on, but here’s how it would look in your code:

```swift
func doAsyncWork() async {
    print("Doing async work")
}

func doRegularWork() {
    Task {
        await doAsyncWork()
    }
}

doRegularWork()
```

Tasks like this one are created and run immediately. We aren’t waiting for the task to complete, so we shouldn’t use `await` when creating it.
