Swift does not provide a built-in way of converting an `AsyncSequence` into a regular `Sequence`, but often you’ll want to make this conversion yourself so you don’t need to keep awaiting results to come back in the future.

The easiest thing to do is call `reduce(into:)` on the sequence, appending each item to an array of the sequence’s element type. To make this more reusable, I’d recommend adding an extension such as this one:

```swift
extension AsyncSequence {
    func collect() async rethrows -> [Element] {
        try await reduce(into: [Element]()) { $0.append($1) }
    }
}
```

With that in place, you can now call `collect()` on any async sequence in order to get a simple array of its values. Because this is an async operation, you must call it using `await` like so:


```swift
extension AsyncSequence {
    func collect() async rethrows -> [Element] {
        try await reduce(into: [Element]()) { $0.append($1) }
    }
}

func getNumberArray() async throws -> [Int] {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/random-numbers.txt")!
    let numbers = url.lines.compactMap(Int.init)
    return try await numbers.collect()
}

if let numbers = try? await getNumberArray() {
    for number in numbers {
        print(number)
    }
}
```

::: tip

Because we’ve made `collect()` use `rethrows`, you only need to call it using `try` if the call to `reduce()` would normally throw, so if you have an async sequence that doesn’t throw errors you can skip `try` entirely.
