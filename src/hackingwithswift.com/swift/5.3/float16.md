> Available from Swift 5.3

[SE-0277 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0277-float16.md) introduced a new half-precision floating point type called `Float16`, which is commonly used in graphics programming and machine learning. 

This new floating-point type fits in alongside Swift’s other similar types:

```swift
let first: Float16 = 5
let second: Float32 = 11
let third: Float64 = 7
let fourth: Float80 = 13
```
