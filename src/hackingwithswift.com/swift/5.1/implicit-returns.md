> Available from Swift 5.1

[SE-0255 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0255-omit-return.md) has removed a small but important inconsistency in the language: single-expression functions that return a value can now remove the `return` keyword and Swift will understand it implicitly.

In previous versions of Swift, single-line closures that returned a value you could omit the `return` keyword because the only line of code that was there *must* be the one that returned a value. So, these two pieces of code were identical:

```swift
let doubled1 = [1, 2, 3].map { $0 * 2 }
let doubled2 = [1, 2, 3].map { return $0 * 2 }
```

In Swift 5.1, this behavior has now been extended to functions as well: if they contain a single expression - effectively a single piece of code that evaluates to a value - then you can leave off the `return` keyword, like this:

```swift
func double(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    number * 2
}
```

That will probably cause some people to do a double take at first, but I’m sure it will become second nature over time.
