> Available from Swift 5.1

Swift’s optionals are implemented as an enum of two cases: `some` and `none`. This gave rise to the possibility of confusion if we created our own enums that had a `none` case, then wrapped that inside an optional.

For example:

```swift
enum BorderStyle {
    case none
    case solid(thickness: Int)
}
```

Used as a non-optional this was always clear:

```swift
let border1: BorderStyle = .none
print(border1)
```

That will print “none”. But if we used an optional for that enum - if we didn’t know what border style to use - then we’d hit problems:

```swift
let border2: BorderStyle? = .none
print(border2)
```

That prints “nil”, because Swift assumes `.none` means the optional is empty, rather than an optional with the value `BorderStyle.none`.

In Swift 5.1 this confusion now prints a warning: “Assuming you mean 'Optional.none'; did you mean 'BorderStyle.none' instead?” This avoids the source compatibility breakage of an error, but at least informs developers that their code might not quite mean what they thought.
