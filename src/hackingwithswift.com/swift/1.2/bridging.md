> Available from Swift 1.2


Prior to Swift 1.2 bridging from Objective-C types to Swift types happened implicitly, meaning that you could use the two interchangeable. From Swift 1.2 onwards you must now use `as` to typecast these yourself. For example:

```swift
authenticateUser(yourNSString as String)
```

::: note

This has changed in later versions of Swift – implicit bridging never happens now.
