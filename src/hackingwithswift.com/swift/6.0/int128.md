> Available from Swift 6.0

[SE-0425 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0425-int128.md) introduces `Int128` and `UInt128`. I literally have nothing more to say about these, because I think you already know exactly how they work – even the evolution proposal says, "the actual API of the types is uninteresting."

Still, I'd feel guilty if I didn't at least give you a code sample, so here goes:

```swift
let enoughForAnybody: Int128 = 170_141_183_460_469_231_731_687_303_715_884_105_727
```
