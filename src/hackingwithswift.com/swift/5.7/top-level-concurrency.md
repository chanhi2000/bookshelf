[SE-0343 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0343-top-level-concurrency.md) upgrades Swift’s support for top-level code – think <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift` in a macOS Command Line Tool project – so that it supports concurrency out of the box. This is one of those changes that might seem trivial on the surface, but [took (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift`)](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/40998) a lot of [work (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift`)](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/41061) to make [happen (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift`)](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/40963).

In practice, it means you can write code like this directly into your <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`main.swift` files:

```swift
import Foundation
let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/readings.json")!
let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
let readings = try JSONDecoder().decode([Double].self, from: data)
print("Found \(readings.count) temperature readings")
```

Previously, we had to create a new `@main` struct that had an asynchronous `main()` method, so this new, simpler approach is a big improvement.
