> Available from Swift 5.6

Swift 5.6 includes a raft (\[[1 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md)\], \[[2 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0305-swiftpm-binary-target-improvements.md)\], \[[3 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0325-swiftpm-additional-plugin-apis.md))\], \[[4 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0332-swiftpm-command-plugins.md)\]) of improvements to Swift Package Manager, which combine to add the beginnings of plugin support using external build tools.
