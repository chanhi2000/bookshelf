> Available from Swift 1.1

In Swift 1.0 you would count an array like this:

```swift
let items = [1, 2, 3]
println(countElements(items))
```

The `countElements()` function has been renamed to `count()` in Swift 1.1, so the new code is this:

```swift
let items = [1, 2, 3]
println(count(items))
```

::: note

This has changed in later versions of Swift – `count` is now a property of strings and collections.
