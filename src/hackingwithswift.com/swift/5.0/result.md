[SE-0235 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0235-add-result.md) introduced a `Result` type into the standard library, giving us a simpler, clearer way of handling errors in complex code such as asynchronous APIs.

Swift’s `Result` type is implemented as an enum that has two cases: `success` and `failure`. Both are implemented using generics so they can have an associated value of your choosing, but `failure` must be something that conforms to Swift’s `Error` type.

To demonstrate `Result`, we could write a function that connects to a server to figure out how many unread messages are waiting for the user. In this example code we’re going to have just one possible error, which is that the requested URL string isn’t a valid URL:

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case badURL
}
```

The fetching function will accept a URL string as its first parameter, and a completion handler as its second parameter. That completion handler will itself accept a `Result`, where the success case will store an integer, and the failure case will be some sort of `NetworkError`. We’re not actually going to connect to a server here, but using a completion handler at least lets us simulate asynchronous code.

Here’s the code:

```swift
import Foundation

func fetchUnreadCount1(from urlString: String, completionHandler: @escaping (Result<Int, NetworkError>) -> Void)  {
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
        completionHandler(.failure(.badURL))
        return
    }

    // complicated networking code here
    print("Fetching \(url.absoluteString)...")
    completionHandler(.success(5))
}
```

To use that code we need to check the value inside our `Result` to see whether our call succeeded or failed, like this:

```swift
fetchUnreadCount1(from: "https://hackingwithswift.com") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let count):
        print("\(count) unread messages.")
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

There are three more things you ought to know before you start using `Result` in your own code.

First, `Result` has a `get()` method that either returns the successful value if it exists, or throws its error otherwise. This allows you to convert `Result` into a regular throwing call, like this:

```swift
fetchUnreadCount1(from: "https://hackingwithswift.com") { result in
    if let count = try? result.get() {
        print("\(count) unread messages.")
    }
}
```

Second, `Result` has an initializer that accepts a throwing closure: if the closure returns a value successfully that gets used for the `success` case, otherwise the thrown error is placed into the `failure` case.

For example:

```swift
let result = Result { try String(contentsOfFile: someFile) }
```

Third, rather than using a specific error enum that you’ve created, you can also use the general `Error` protocol. In fact, the Swift Evolution proposal says “it's expected that most uses of Result will use `Swift.Error` as the `Error` type argument.”

So, rather than using `Result<Int, NetworkError>` you could use `Result<Int, Error>`. Although this means you lose the safety of typed throws, you gain the ability to throw a variety of different error enums – which you prefer really depends on your coding style.
