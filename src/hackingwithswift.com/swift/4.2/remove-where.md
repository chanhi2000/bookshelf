[SE-0197 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0197-remove-where.md) introduced a new `removeAll(where:)` method that performs a high-performance, in-place filter for collections. You give it a closure condition to run, and it will strip out all objects that match the condition.

For example, if you have a collection of names and want to remove people called “Terry”, you’d use this:

```swift
var pythons = ["John", "Michael", "Graham", "Terry", "Eric", "Terry"]
pythons.removeAll { $0.hasPrefix("Terry") }
print(pythons)
```

Now, you might very well think that you could accomplish that by using `filter()` like this:

```swift
pythons = pythons.filter { !$0.hasPrefix("Terry") }
```

However, that doesn’t use memory very efficiently, it specifies what you *don’t* want rather than what you *want*, and more advanced in-place solutions come with a range of complexities that are off-putting to novices. Ben Cohen, the author of SE-0197, gave a talk at [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>dotSwift 2018](https://www.dotconferences.com/2018/01/ben-cohen-extending-the-standard-library) where he discussed the implementation of this proposal in more detail - if you’re keen to learn why it’s so efficient, you should start there!
