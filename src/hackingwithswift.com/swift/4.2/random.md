> Available from Swift 4.2

[SE-0202 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md) introduced a new random API that’s native to Swift. This means you can for the most part stop using `arc4random_uniform()` and GameplayKit to get randomness, and instead rely on a cryptographically secure randomizer that’s baked right into the core of the language.

You can generate random numbers by calling the `random()` method on whatever numeric type you want, providing the range you want to work with. For example, this generates a random number in the range 1 through 4, inclusive on both sides:

```swift
let randomInt = Int.random(in: 1..<5)
```

Similar methods exist for `Float`, `Double`, and `CGFloat`:

```swift
let randomFloat = Float.random(in: 1..<10)
let randomDouble = Double.random(in: 1...100)
let randomCGFloat = CGFloat.random(in: 1...1000)
```

There’s also one for booleans, generating either true or false randomly:

```swift
let randomBool = Bool.random()
```

Checking a random boolean is effectively the same as checking `Int.random(in: 0...1) == 1`, but it expresses your intent more clearly.

[SE-0202 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0202-random-unification.md) also includes support for shuffling arrays using new `shuffle()` and `shuffled()` methods depending on whether you want in-place shuffling or not. For example:

```swift
var albums = ["Red", "1989", "Reputation"]

// shuffle in place
albums.shuffle()

// get a shuffled array back
let shuffled = albums.shuffled()
```

It also adds a new `randomElement()` method to arrays, which returns one random element from the array if it isn’t empty, or nil otherwise:

```swift
if let random = albums.randomElement() {
    print("The random album is \(random).")
}
```
