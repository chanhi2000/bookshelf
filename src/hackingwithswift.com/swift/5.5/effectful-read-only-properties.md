[SE-0310 (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0310-effectful-readonly-properties.md) upgrades Swift’s read-only properties to support the `async` and `throws` keywords, either individually or together, making them significantly more flexible.

To demonstrate this, we could create a `BundleFile` struct that attempts to load the contents of a file in our app’s resource bundle. Because the file might not be there, might be there but can’t be read for some reason, or might be readable but so big it takes time to read, we could mark the `contents` property as `async throws` like this:

```swift
import Foundation

enum FileError: Error {
    case missing, unreadable
}

struct BundleFile {
    let filename: String

    var contents: String {
        get async throws {
            guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: filename, withExtension: nil) else {
                throw FileError.missing
            }

            do {
                return try String(contentsOf: url)
            } catch {
                throw FileError.unreadable
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Because `contents` is both async and throwing, we must use `try await` when trying to read it:

```swift
func printHighScores() async throws {
    let file = BundleFile(filename: "highscores")
    try await print(file.contents)
}
```
