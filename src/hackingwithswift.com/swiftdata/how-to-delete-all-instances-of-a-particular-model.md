> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftData’s `ModelContext` class has a dedicated `delete(model:)` method that removes from your context all instances of a particular model. Once a save is triggered, either manually or using autosave, the objects will be deleted from disk too.

For example, if we had a `Student` model we could delete all its instances like this:

```swift
do {
    try modelContext.delete(model: Student.self)
} catch {
    print("Failed to delete students.")
}
```

If you want only *some* of your model instances to be deleted, provide a predicate to the `where` parameter like this. For example, if we wanted to delete all schools that don’t have any active students, we’d write this:

```swift
try modelContext.delete(model: School.self, where: #Predicate { $0.students.isEmpty })
```

::: tip

Technically the `delete(model:)` method has an overload that allows an `includeSubclasses` Boolean to be passed in. As far as I can tell this is impossible to use, because SwiftData models cannot be subclassed at the time of writing.
