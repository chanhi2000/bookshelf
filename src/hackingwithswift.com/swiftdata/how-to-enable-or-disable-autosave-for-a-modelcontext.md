> Updated for Xcode 16

SwiftUI provides a built-in model context called the main context, and it has autosave enabled – SwiftData will automatically save your changes but you can also create a custom model context without that.

If you want to do this across your whole app – if you want your primary model context to have save disabled – then you would modify your `App` struct to this:

```swift
WindowGroup {
    ContentView()
}
.modelContainer(for: User.self, isAutosaveEnabled: false)
```

::: important To be clear

This means you’re responsible for calling `save()` on your model context manually.

:::

If you’re making a new context by hand, autosave is usually automatically disabled. You can enable it by adjust its `autosaveEnabled` Boolean like this:

```swift
let newContext = ModelContext(container)
print(newContext.autosaveEnabled)
newContext.autosaveEnabled = true
```

::: tip

It's not specified exactly when autosave is enabled for new contexts, so I'd recommend setting the value explicitly to avoid problems.
