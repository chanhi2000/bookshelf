Swift developers love using structs, but SwiftData uses classes intentionally:

1. They allow us to share SwiftData objects in many places, so that when we make a change in one place that change appears everywhere else the data is used. This is the same reason why `ObservableObject` and `@Observable` types also rely on classes.
2. Using a class allows a model to create a relationship to another instance of itself. For example, we might say that each employee in a company has a manager, who is also an employee.

As a result, the `@Model` macro can be used only on classes.

That being said, you can *integrate* structs into your models if you want, as long as the structs conform to `Codable`. For example, you might say this:

```swift
@Model
class Customer {
    var name: String
    var address: Address

    init(name: String, address: Address) {
        self.name = name
        self.address = address
    }
}

struct Address: Codable {
    var line1: String
    var line2: String
    var city: String
    var postCode: String
}
```

This can be a neat way of breaking your data models up into more manageable parts, although for most relationships I would recommend using `@Model` classes across the board because it allows you to query your data more broadly.
