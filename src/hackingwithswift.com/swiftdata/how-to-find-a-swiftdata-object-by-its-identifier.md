Rather annoyingly this will cause a crash if your persistent identifier is invalid, so I prefer to use the `registeredModel(for:)` variant that only returns an object if it exists in the current model context. (Of course, that has its own problems because your model context likely only contains a subset of all the objects in your container!)
