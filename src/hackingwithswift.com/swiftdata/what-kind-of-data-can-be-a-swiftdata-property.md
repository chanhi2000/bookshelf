SwiftData is capable of storing a variety of data, but specifically the following:

1. Any class that uses the `@Model` macro.
2. Any struct that conforms to the `Codable` protocol.
3. Any enum that conforms to the `Codable` protocol, even if it includes raw values or associated values.

::: important

If you intend to use options 2 or 3 in a hybrid app – using both SwiftData and Core Data side by side – it’s important that you use composite attributes in your Core Data code in order to retain compatibility.

For example, we could create a `Status` enum that has two cases, one of which has an associated value, then use that as one value inside

```swift
enum Status: Codable {
    case active, inactive(reason: String)
}

@Model
class User {
    var name: String
    var status: Status

    init(name: String, status: Status) {
        self.name = name
        self.status = status
    }
}
```
