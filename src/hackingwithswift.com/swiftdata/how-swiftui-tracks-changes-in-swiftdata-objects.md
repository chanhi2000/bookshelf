> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI and SwiftData are built with tight coordination, which allows SwiftUI to update its views only when your SwiftData object changes a value that actually matters – any property that is actually used by the view will cause an update, but changing other values won't.

Internally this is all powered by Swift's observation system: when SwiftUI renders a view it makes a list of all the properties that are read from `Observable` objects, then watch those properties – and only those – for changes. When any *do* change, that view gets re-evaluated and the whole process repeats.

::: tip

This whole process works equally well with computed properties – as long as calling a computed property refers to a stored property on your object, SwiftUI will take note that it was accessed when your view was rendered.

:::

Because SwiftData's objects are built on top of the Swift's observation system, all our objects automatically inherit this same power: views that use one of your model objects won't update until a property they directly rely on has changed. So, if your view refers to a user's name, it won't refresh if that's user's age changes – it's a big performance win.

::: important

If you have a SwiftUI view that depends on one or more properties from a SwiftData object, changing that property will cause the view to be invalidated and re-rendered even if it's currently positioned off-screen.
