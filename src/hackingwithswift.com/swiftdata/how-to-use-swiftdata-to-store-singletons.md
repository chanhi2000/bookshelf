Given how easy SwiftData makes data storage, you’re likely to be tempted to want to use it for general app storage such as settings and more. However, this takes a little more work because the `@Query` macro is designed to return collections of model objects rather than a single instance.

They here is to create a custom fetch request to read the whole collection of results, then simply return the first one to get your data, or create a fresh instance if there was nothing already saved.

As an example, we might have an `AppSettings` model such as this one:

```swift
@Model class AppSettings {
    var name: String
    var location: String
    var selectedTopics: [String]

    init(name: String, location: String, selectedTopics: [String]) {
        self.name = name
        self.location = location
        self.selectedTopics = selectedTopics
    }
}
```

We could then load that either at app launch, or using `onAppear()` inside a root view such as this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.modelContext) var modelContext
    @State private var settings: AppSettings?

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack {
                if let settings {
                    Text("Name: \(settings.name)")
                    Text("Location: \(settings.location)")
                    Text("Topics: \(settings.selectedTopics.formatted(.list(type: .and)))")
                } else {
                    Text("Loading…")
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Singletons")
            .onAppear(perform: load)
        }
    }

    func load() {
        let request = FetchDescriptor<AppSettings>()
        let data = try? modelContext.fetch(request)
        settings = data?.first ?? AppSettings(name: "Anonymous", location: "Unknown", selectedTopics: ["Latest News"])
    }
}
```

While this approach definitely works, it’s worth asking whether it’s the best option – would using a simple `Codable` type work better, for example? 

::: note

Although SwiftData supports working with document-based apps, it does not provide the document as a singleton inside there – you still need to issue a query for a collection of results.
