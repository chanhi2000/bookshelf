All SwiftData model objects have an `isDeleted` property that determines whether it is deleted or not, but it needs to be used carefully.

First, when you ask your model context to delete an object, it is only *marked* for deletion. The actual deletion won't take place until the next save is triggered; in the meantime the object will still be around, just stored in the `deletedModelsArray` of your context. Objects marked for deletion but not yet *actually* deleted will still appear in results from `@Query`.

Second, if any part of your app retains a copy of a deleted model, `isDeleted` will appear `true` at first, but it may then flip back to `false` – even though the object itself has been deleted.

Third, if you don't have autosave enabled *and* any part of your app retains a copy of the deleted model, attempting to change any properties is likely to result in a crash because the underlying data has been destroyed.

Fourth, as a result of all these there's very little point trying to read the `isDeleted` in the `disabled()` SwiftUI view modifier – you might think it's helpful to disable a form if an object no longer exists, but in practice it's just a bit too quirky to rely upon.
