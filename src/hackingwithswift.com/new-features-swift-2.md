I already wrote overviews of [all the new features of Swift 2](/hackingwithswift.com/swift2.md) and [the new features in iOS 9](/hackingwithswift.com/ios9.md), but I wanted to get into more depth with some of the Swift 2 language changes so you could start getting to grips with it.

So, I wrote four short articles explaining four key new features in Swift 2 syntax: try catch error handling, guard, defer and API availability checking.

You can work through them in any order you want – enjoy!

::: info UPDATE

I put together a [huge and free collection of Swift example code](/hackingwithswift.com/example-code/README.md), so if you're upgrading your code you should definitely check it out.
<!-- TODO: add VPCard -->

:::

- [Error handling in Swift 2: `try`, `catch`, `do` and `throw`](/hackingwithswift.com/new-syntax-swift-2-error-handling-try-catch.md) – it's been entirely rewritten to be modern, fast and safe, and unless you use only a small subset of the iOS APIs you're going to need to learn about it,
- [The `guard` keyword in Swift 2: early returns made easy](/hackingwithswift.com/new-syntax-swift-2-guard.md) – `guard` takes an `if` statement and adds extra optional unwrapping power, amongst other things.
- [The `defer` keyword in Swift 2: `try`/`finally` done right](/hackingwithswift.com/new-syntax-swift-2-defer.md") – if you return from a method at the end or part way through, or if you exit a method by throwing an error, your deferred work will take place.
- [Availability checking in Swift 2: backwards compatibility the smart way](/hackingwithswift.com/new-syntax-swift-2-availability-checking.md) – great for using `if #available` to run version-specific code in small blocks.
