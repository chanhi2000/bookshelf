In the past, creating analytical web applications was a task for seasoned developers that required knowledge of multiple programming languages and frameworks. That’s no longer the case. Nowadays, you can make data visualization interfaces using pure Python. One popular tool for this is [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction).

Dash gives data scientists the ability to showcase their results in interactive web applications. You don’t need to be an expert in [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>web development](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/become-python-web-developer/). In an afternoon, you can build and deploy a Dash app to share with others.

::: info In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to

- Create a **Dash application**
- Use Dash **core components** and **HTML components**
- **Customize the style** of your Dash application
- Use **callbacks** to build interactive applications
- Deploy your application on **PythonAnywhere**

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You just built, customized, and deployed your first dashboard using Dash. You went from a bare-bones dashboard to a fully interactive one deployed on PythonAnywhere.

With this knowledge, you can use Dash to build analytical applications to share with others. As more companies put more weight on the use of data, knowing how to use Dash will increase your impact in the workplace. What used to be a task only experts could perform, you can now do in an afternoon.

::: info In this tutorial, you’ve learned

- How to **create a dashboard** using Dash
- How to **customize** the styling of your Dash application
- How to make your app **interactive** by using Dash components
- What **callbacks** are and how you can use them to create interactive applications
- How to **deploy** your application on PythonAnywhere

:::

Now you’re ready to develop new Dash applications. Find a dataset, think of some exciting visualizations, and build another dashboard!
