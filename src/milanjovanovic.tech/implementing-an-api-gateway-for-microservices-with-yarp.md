Large **Microservice-based** systems can consist of tens or even hundreds of individual services. A client application needs to have all of this information to be able to make requests to the relevant **microservice** directly.

However, this has numerous issues, such as security concerns, increased complexity, and coupling.

We can solve this by introducing an **API gateway** that acts as a **reverse proxy** to accept API calls from the client application and forward them to the appropriate service.

The **API gateway** also enforces security and ensures scalability and high availability.

In this week's newsletter, I'll show you how to implement an **API gateway** for your **microservices system** using the **YARP reverse proxy**.

Here's what we will cover:

- Difference between **API gateway** and **reverse proxy**
- Installing and configuring **YARP**
- Creating an **API gateway** with **YARP**
- **Authentication** and **rate limiting** on the **API gateway**

Let's dive in.

## What's The Difference Between an API Gateway And a Reverse Proxy?

A **reverse proxy** and an **API gateway** are similar concepts, but they serve different purposes.

A **reverse proxy** acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. The clients can only call the backend servers through the **reverse proxy**, which forwards the request to the appropriate server. It hides the implementation details of individual servers inside the internal network.

A **reverse proxy** is commonly used for:

- Load balancing
- Caching
- Security
- SSL termination

![](https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_045/reverse_proxy.png?imwidth=3840)

An **API gateway** is a specific type of **reverse proxy** designed for managing APIs. It acts as a single entry point for API consumers to the various backend services.

The key characteristics of an **API gateway** are:

- Request routing and composition
- Request/response transformations
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Monitoring

Also, note that an **API gateway** can perform **load balancing** and other functionalities mentioned for reverse proxies.

Now let's see how to use a **reverse proxy** to implement an **API gateway**.

---

## Installing And Configuring YARP

**YARP** (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) is a library developed by Microsoft to address the needs of various teams needing to build a **reverse proxy**. It's open source and built with .NET, so it integrates nicely with the existing ecosystem.

Let's install `Yarp.ReverseProxy` **NuGet** package to get started:

```powershell
Install-Package Yarp.ReverseProxy
```

Next, we're going to call:

- `AddReverseProxy` to add the required services for **YARP**
- `LoadFromConfig` to load the **reverse proxy** configuration from application settings
- `MapReverseProxy` to introduce the **reverse proxy** middleware

```cs{3-4,8}
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddReverseProxy()
    .LoadFromConfig(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ReverseProxy"));

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapReverseProxy();

app.Run();
```

We need to tell the **YARP** reverse proxy how to route the incoming requests to the individual microservices.

**YARP** uses the concept of `Routes` to represent request patterns for the proxy and `Clusters` to represent the services to forward those requests.

```json{3,6}
{
    "ReverseProxy": {
        "Routes": {
            ...
        },
        "Clusters": {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Here's an example **YARP configuration** with a `{**catch-all}` pattern that will route all incoming requests to the one destination server.

```json
{
  "ReverseProxy": {
    "Routes": {
      "ROUTE_NAME": {
        "ClusterId": "CLUSTER_NAME",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "{**catch-all}"
        }
      }
    },
    "Clusters": {
      "CLUSTER_NAME": {
        "Destinations": {
          "destination1": {
            "Address": "https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementing an API Gateway With YARP

We can use **YARP** to build an **API gateway** by providing the configuration for the services we want to route traffic to.

I created a sample [API gateway implementation with YARP (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`m-jovanovic/yarp-api-gateway-sample`)](https://github.com/m-jovanovic/yarp-api-gateway-sample) on GitHub, so you can give it a try. The system has two services, the `Users.Api` and `Products.Api`, which are .NET 7 applications.

If a request comes in matching the `/users-service/{**catch-all}`, for example `/users-service/users`, it will be routed to the `users-cluster`.
The same logic applies for the `products-cluster`. We can apply more advanced transformations through the `Transforms` section.

```json
{
  "ReverseProxy": {
    "Routes": {
      "users-route": {
        "ClusterId": "users-cluster",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/users-service/{**catch-all}"
        },
        "Transforms": [{ "PathPattern": "{**catch-all}" }]
      },
      "products-route": {
        "ClusterId": "products-cluster",
        "Match": {
          "Path": "/products-service/{**catch-all}"
        },
        "Transforms": [{ "PathPattern": "{**catch-all}" }]
      }
    },
    "Clusters": {
      "users-cluster": {
        "Destinations": {
          "destination1": {
            "Address": "https://localhost:5201/"
          }
        }
      },
      "products-cluster": {
        "Destinations": {
          "destination1": {
            "Address": "https://localhost:5101/"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We now have a functioning **API gateway** built with **YARP**, routing requests to two individual services.

But what else can we do with **YARP**?

---

## Adding Authentication

The **API gateway** can enforce **authentication** and **authorization** at the entry point to the system before letting authenticated requests proceed.

And **YARP** supports integrating with the existing authentication & authorization middleware.

You first need to define an **authorization policy**:

```cs
builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("authenticated", policy =>
        policy.RequireAuthenticatedUser());
});
```

And call `UseAuthentication` and `UseAuthorization` to add the respective middleware to the request pipeline.
It's important to add them before calling `MapReverseProxy`.

```cs{1,3}
app.UseAuthentication();

app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapReverseProxy();
```

Now all you have to do is add the `AuthorizationPolicy` section to the reverse proxy configuration:

```json{3}
"users-route": {
  "ClusterId": "users-cluster",
  "AuthorizationPolicy": "authenticated",
  "Match": {
    "Path": "/users-service/{**catch-all}"
  },
  "Transforms": [
    { "PathPattern": "{**catch-all}" }
  ]
}
```

**YARP** will forward most credentials to the proxied services, such as cookies or bearer tokens because it might be important to identify the user in the individual microservices.

---

## Adding Rate Limiting

You can also use an **API gateway** to introduce **rate limiting** to your system. It's a technique to limit the number of requests to your API to **improve security** and reduce the load on the servers.

You can learn more about [how to use rate limiting in .NET here](/milanjovanovic.tech/how-to-use-rate-limiting-in-aspnet-core.md).

As you can already guess, **YARP** supports the native **rate limiting** mechanism added in .NET 7.

All you need to do is define a **rate limit policy**:

```cs
builder.Services.AddRateLimiter(rateLimiterOptions =>
{
    rateLimiterOptions.AddFixedWindowLimiter("fixed", options =>
    {
        options.Window = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
        options.PermitLimit = 5;
    });
});
```

Then you need to call `UseRateLimiter` to add the rate limiter middleware to the request pipeline.
It's important to do it before calling `MapReverseProxy`.

```cs{1}
app.UseRateLimiter();

app.MapReverseProxy();
```

And then, you can apply rate limiting to the desired route using the `RateLimiterPolicy` section in the reverse proxy configuration:

```json{3}
"products-route": {
  "ClusterId": "products-cluster",
  "RateLimiterPolicy": "fixed",
  "Match": {
    "Path": "/products-service/{**catch-all}"
  },
  "Transforms": [
    { "PathPattern": "{**catch-all}" }
  ]
}
```

## In Summary

An **API gateway** is a critical component for a robust **microservices system** implementation.

And **YARP** is an excellent option if you want to build an **API gateway** with .NET.

I created a sample API gateway implementation with YARP, which you can find [here (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`m-jovanovic/yarp-api-gateway-sample`)](https://github.com/m-jovanovic/yarp-api-gateway-sample). The system consists of two APIs, and the API gateway is configured to route requests between them. It also implements:

- [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>Authentication](https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/authn-authz.html)
- [Rate limiting](/milanjovanovic.tech/how-to-use-rate-limiting-in-aspnet-core.md)

In this newsletter, we only scratched the surface of what's possible with **YARP**.

Here are some useful resources if you want to learn more:
