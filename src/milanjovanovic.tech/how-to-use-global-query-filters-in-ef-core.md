In this week's newsletter, I'll show you how you can remove repetitive conditions in **EF Core** database queries.

Which kinds of queries fit this description?

An example would be when you implement **soft-delete**, and have to check if a record was **soft-deleted** or not in every query.

Also, it's practical if you're working in a multi-tenant system and need to specify a `tenantId` on every query.

**EF Core** has a powerful feature that can help you remove repetitive conditions from your code.

I'm talking about [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>Query Filters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/filters).

Let's see how we can implement it.

## How To Apply Query Filters

Before introducing **Query Filters**, we will see how the standard approach looks. We have an `Orders` table that supports **soft-deleting**. And we never want to return **soft-deleted** orders.

We'll start with an `Order` entity that has an `IsDeleted` property.

```cs
public class Order
{
   public int Id { get; set; }
   public bool IsDeleted { get; set; }
}
```

And we have a business requirement that we can only query orders that are not deleted.

Here's what an **EF** query to get a single `Order` might look like:

```cs
dbContext
   .Orders
   .Where(order => !order.IsDeleted)
   .Where(order => order.Id == orderId)
   .FirstOrDefault();
```

This works perfectly for what we need to do.

However, we need to remember to apply this condition every time we want to query the `Order` entity.

Now, let's see how we can define a **Query Filter** on the `Order` entity to apply this check when querying the database.

Inside of the `OnModelCreating` method on the database context, we need to call the `HasQueryFilter` method and specify the expression we want:

```cs
modelBuilder
   .Entity<Order>()
   .HasQueryFilter(order => !order.IsDeleted);
```

Now we can omit the **soft-delete** check from the previous **LINQ** expression:

```cs
dbContext
   .Orders
   .Where(order => order.Id == orderId)
   .FirstOrDefault();
```

And this is the **SQL** that **EF** will generate with the **Query Filter**:

```sql
SELECT o.*
FROM Orders o
WHERE o.IsDeleted = FALSE AND o.Id = @orderId
```

## Disabling Query Filters

You may run into a situation where you need to disable **Query Filters** for a specific query. Luckily, there is an easy way to do this.

In your **LINQ** expression, you need to call the `IgnoreQueryFilters` method, and all the **Query Filters** configured for this entity will be disabled:

```cs
dbContext
   .Orders
   .IgnoreQueryFilters()
   .Where(order => order.Id == orderId)
   .FirstOrDefault();
```

Be careful when doing this, as you can easily introduce unwanted behavior in your application.

## Good Things To Know Before Using Query Filters

Here are a few more details that you should know about **Query Filters** before using them. Hopefully, this will save you some trouble if you decide to use them in your application.

### Configuring multiple Query Filters

Configuring multiple **Query Filters** on the same entity will only apply the last one. If you need more than one condition, you can do that with the logical `AND` operator (&&).

### Ignoring specific Query Filters

If you need to ignore a specific expression in a **Query Filter** and leave the rest in place,
unfortunately, you can't do that. Only one **Query Filter** is allowed per entity type.

One solution is calling `IgnoreQueryFilters`, which will remove the configured **Query Filter**
for that entity type. And then manually apply the condition that you need for that specific query.
