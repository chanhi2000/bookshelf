Working with **Microservices**, or any distributed system for that matter, is difficult. In a distributed system many things can go wrong, and there are even research papers about this. If you want to explore this topic further, I suggest that you read about the [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-file-pdf"/>fallacies of distributed computing](https://se.rit.edu/~se442/doc/fallacies.pdf).

Reducing the surface area for things to go wrong should be one of your goals, as an engineer. In this week's newsletter, we'll try to achieve exactly that using the **Outbox pattern**.

How can you implement reliable communication between components in a distributed system?

The **Outbox pattern** is an elegant solution to this problem, allowing you to achieve transactional guarantees in a single service and at-least-once message delivery to external systems.

Let's see how the **Outbox pattern** solves this and how can we implement it.

## What Problem Does The Outbox Pattern Solve?

To understand what problem the **Outbox pattern** solves, first we need a problem, of course.

Here's an example of a user registration flow. There are a few things going on here:

- Saving the `User` to the database
- Sending a welcome email to the `User`
- Publishing a `UserRegisteredEvent` to a message bus

```cs
public async Task RegisterUserAsync(User user, CancellationToken token)
{
    _userRepository.Insert(user);

    await _unitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync(token);

    await _emailService.SendWelcomeEmailAsync(user, token);

    await _eventBus.PublishAsync(new UserRegisteredEvent(user.Id), token);
}
```

In the happy path, all of the operations complete without any issues and all is well.

But what happens if any one of these operations fail?

- The database is unavailable, and saving the `User` fails
- The email service is down and sending an email crashes
- Publishing an event to the service bus doesn't succeed

Also, imagine a situation where you manage to save a `User` to the database, send him a welcome email, but fail to publish the `UserRegisteredEvent` to notify other services. How are you going to recover from this scenario?

The **Outbox pattern** allows you to **atommically** update the database and send messages to the message bus.

## Implementing The Outbox Pattern

The first step is to introduce a table in your database to represent the **Outbox**. We can call this table `OutboxMessages`, and it's intended to store all messages that need to be delivered. Now instead of directly making requests to external services, we simply store a message as a new row in the **Outbox** table. The messages are usually stored as JSON in the database.

The second step is to introduce a **background process** that will periodically poll the `OutboxMessages` table. If the worker process finds a row with an unprocessed message, it's going to publish that message and mark it as sent. If publishing the message fails for some reason, the work process can **retry** in the next execution.

Notice that with retries, you now have **at-least-once message delivery** implemented. The message will be published exactly once for the happy path, and more than one time in case or retries.

We can rewrite the `RegisterUserAsync` method from the previous example, now using an **Outbox**:

```cs
public async Task RegisterUserAsync(User user, CancellationToken token)
{
    _userRepository.Insert(user);

    _outbox.Insert(new UserRegisteredEvent(user.Id));

    await _unitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync(token);
}

```

The **Outbox** is part of the same transaction as our unit of work, so we can atomically save the `User` to the database and also persist the `OutboxMessage`. If saving to the database fails, the entire transaction is rolled back and no messages are sent to the message bus.

And since we now moved the publishing of the `UserRegisteredEvent` to the worker process, we need to add a handler so that we can send the welcome email to the user. Here's an example of that in the `SendWelcomeEmailHandler` class:

```cs
public class SendWelcomeEmailHandler : IHandle<UserRegisteredEvent>
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepository;
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    public SendWelcomeEmailHandler(
        IUserRepository userRepository,
        IEmailService emailService)
    {
        _userRepository = userRepository;
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public async Task Handle(UserRegisteredEvent message)
    {
        var user = await _userRepository.GetByIdAsync(message.UserId);

        await _emailService.SendWelcomeEmailAsync(user);
    }
}
```

## Architecture Diagram With Outbox

Here's a high level overview of the system architecture with the **Outbox** introduced to the system. You can see the `Outbox` table in the database. What changes now is that you store messages to the `Outbox` table in the same transaction along with your entities.
