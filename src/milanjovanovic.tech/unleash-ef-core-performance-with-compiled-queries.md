In this week's newsletter I want to introduce you to an interesting feature in **EF Core** called **Compiled Queries**.

If you have queries that you execute frequently in your application with a different set of parameters, it can be helpful to explicitly compile the query and reuse it throughout the lifetime of your application.

**Compiled Queries** are more performant than standard EF queries, because they can take advantage of some additional optimizations.

Let me show you how to use **Compiled Queries**, and how much performance improvement to expect!

## How To Create Compiled Queries

Lets define a simple class that will represent out data model that we will use for writing **EF** queries:

```cs
public class Newsletter
{
    public long Id { get; init; }

    public string Title { get; init; }

    public int ReadTimeInMinutes { get; init; }
}
```

How would we write a simple query to fetch a `Newsletter` by the `Id`? I think you can do this in your sleep.

```cs
using var dbContext = new AppDbContext();

var newsletter = dbContext.Set<Newsletter>().FirstOrDefault(n => n.Id == id);
```

Now, how do we convert this query into a **Complied Query**?

There are a few steps involved:

- Create a **Compiled Query** by calling `EF.CompileQuery`
- Store the **Compiled Query** in a static field, so that it can be reused
- Execute the database query using the **Compiled Query**

You can define the **Compiled Query** in a static field inside of the `AppDbContext`. And then expose a method that will accept an argument, and pass it to the **Compiled Query** to invoke it.

```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class AppDbContext
{
    private static Func<AppDbContext, long, Newsletter?> GetNewsletter =
        EF.CompileQuery(
            (dbContext, id) =>
                dbContext.Set<Newsletter>().FirstOrDefault(n => n.Id == id));

    public Newsletter? GetNewsletter(long id)
    {
        return GetNewsletter(this, id);
    }
}
```

This is how we would call the method which invokes the **Compiled Query**:

```cs
using var dbContext = new AppDbContext();

var newsletter = dbContext.GetNewsletter(id);
```

I ran some benchmarks, with the following setup:

- **EF Core 7**
- **SQL Server 2022**
- Table with 10,000 records

The **Compiled Query** was consistently around **10% faster**.

I also tried running a no-tracking query by calling `AsNoTracking()` and observed similar results.

## Why Are Compiled Queries Faster?

So we can conclude that **Compiled Queries** are faster. But why is that?

Let's examine what happens when we execute an **EF** LINQ query. Before **EF** can convert the query into valid SQL that can be executed in the database, it needs to compile the query. The compiled query is cached and **EF** will be able to reuse that cached query. In some situations the query needs to be recompiled, introducing additional performance costs.

When we explicitly compile the query by calling `EF.CompileQuery`, we can utilize some optimization techniques that aren't available at runtime.

Note that **Compiled Queries** only improve the performance of the in-memory portion of executing an EF query. The round trip time and materializing results from the database remain unaffected.

---

## Can We Make Compiled Queries Asynchronous?

I showed you how to write a synchronous **Compiled Query**. But due to performance considerations we almost always want to execute database queries asynchronously.

Here's how we can create an asynchronous **Compiled Query**:

```cs
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class AppDbContext
{
    private static Func<AppDbContext, string, Task<Newsletter?>> GetByTitle =
        EF.CompileAsyncQuery(
            (AppDbContext context, string title) =>
                context.Set<Newsletter>().FirstOrDefault(c => c.Title == title));

    public async Task<Newsletter?> GetNewsletterByTitleAsync(string title)
    {
        return await GetByTitle(this, title);
    }
}
```

It's interesting that we aren't writing an asynchronous query in the expression passed to `EF.CompileAsyncQuery`. It will be converted to an asynchronous query during compilation.

---

## Compiled Queries Aren't a Silver Bullet

You might be tempted to go and convert all of your **EF** queries into **Compiled Queries**, to squeeze out that last little bit of performance. I urge you not do it. **Compiled Queries** are a useful tool, but they aren't the solution to all your problems.

Instead, I think we should use **Compiled Queries** sparingly, only in situations where we really need to do these kinds of micro-optimizations.

Although **Compiled Queries** seem great, we can't deny they increase the complexity of our code considerably. If you think the slight performance improvement gained from using **Compiled Queries** justifies the increase in complexity, then by all means, you should use them. Otherwise, I would look for other ways to improve performance.
