**Clean Architecture** is a popular approach to structuring your application.

It's a layered architecture that splits the project into four layers:

Each of the layers is typically one project in your solution.

Here's a visual representation of the **Clean Architecture**:

How do we create this in our .NET solutions?

---

## Domain Layer

The **Domain layer** sits at the core of the **Clean Architecture**. Here we define things like: entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events, exceptions, repository interfaces, etc.

Here is the folder structure I like to use:

```
📁 Domain
|__ 📁 DomainEvents
|__ 📁 Entities
|__ 📁 Exceptions
|__ 📁 Repositories
|__ 📁 Shared
|__ 📁 ValueObjects
```

You can introduce more things here if you think it's required.

One thing to note is that the **Domain layer** is not allowed to reference other projects in your solution.

---

## Application Layer

The **Application layer** sits right above the **Domain layer**. It acts as an orchestrator for the **Domain layer**, containing the most important use cases in your application.

You can structure your use cases using services or using commands and queries.

I'm a big fan of the **CQRS** pattern, so I like to use the command and query approach.

Here is the folder structure I like to use:

```
📁 Application
|__ 📁 Abstractions
    |__ 📁 Data
    |__ 📁 Email
    |__ 📁 Messaging
|__ 📁 Behaviors
|__ 📁 Contracts
|__ 📁 Entity1
    |__ 📁 Commands
    |__ 📁 Events
    |__ 📁 Queries
|__ 📁 Entity2
    |__ 📁 Commands
    |__ 📁 Events
    |__ 📁 Queries
```

In the `Abstractions` folder, I define the interfaces required for the **Application layer**. The implementations for these interfaces are in one of the upper layers.

For every entity in the **Domain layer**, I create one folder with the commands, queries, and events definitions.

---

## Infrastructure Layer

The **Infrastructure layer** contains implementations for external-facing services.

What would fall into this category?

- Databases - PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Identity providers - Auth0, Keycloak
- Emails providers
- Storage services - AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage
- Message queues - Rabbit MQ

Here is the folder structure I like to use:

```
📁 Infrastructure
|__ 📁 BackgroundJobs
|__ 📁 Services
    |__ 📁 Email
    |__ 📁 Messaging
|__ 📁 Persistence
    |__ 📁 EntityConfigurations
    |__ 📁 Migrations
    |__ 📁 Repositories
    |__ #️⃣ ApplicationDbContext.cs
|__ 📁 ...
```

I place my `DbContext` implementation here if I'm using **EF Core**.

It's not uncommon to make the Persistence folder its project. I frequently do this to have all database facing-code inside of one project.

---

## Presentation Layer

The **Presentation layer** is the entry point to our system. Typically, you would implement this as a Web API project.

The most important part of the **Presentation layer** is the `Controllers`, which define the API endpoints in our system.

Here is the folder structure I like to use:

```
📁 Presentation
|__ 📁 Controllers
|__ 📁 Middlewares
|__ 📁 ViewModels
|__ 📁 ...
|__ #️⃣ Program.cs

```

Sometimes, I will move the **Presentation layer** away from the actual Web API project. I do this to isolate the `Controllers` and enforce stricter constraints. You don't have to do this if it is too complicated for you.

## Is This The Only Way?

You don't have to follow the folder structure I proposed to the T. **Clean Architecture** is very flexible, and you can experiment with it and structure it the way you like.

Do you like more granularity? Create more specific projects.

Do you dislike a lot of projects? Separate concerns using folders.

I'm here to give you options to explore. But it's up to you to decide what's best.
