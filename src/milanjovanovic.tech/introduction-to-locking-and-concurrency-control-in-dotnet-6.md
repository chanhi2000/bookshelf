In this week's newsletter, we'll see how we can work with **locking** in **.NET 6**.

We won't talk about how the lock is actually implemented at the operating system level. Instead, I will focus on application-level **locking** mechanisms.

**Locking** allows us to control how many **threads** can access some piece of code. Why would you want to do this?

Usually because you want to protect access to **expensive resources**, and you need the **concurrency control** that locking enables.

We will use a simple `BankAccount` class with a `Deposit` method to illustrate how to implement locking.

## The C# Lock Statement

The C# language supports locking with the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>`lock` statement](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/lock). You can use the `lock` statement to define a code block that only one thread can access.

The `lock` statement acquires a mutual-exclusion lock (mutex) for a given object, executes the statement block, and releases the lock.

```cs
lock(_lock)
{
   // Your code...
}
```

Here `_lock` is a reference type, usually an `object` instance.

Let's see how we can implement the `BankAccount` class using the `lock` statement:

```cs
public class BankAccount
{
   private static readonly object _lock = new();
   private decimal _balance;

   public void Deposit(decimal amount)
   {
      lock(_lock)
      {
         _balance += amount;
      }
   }
}
```

The first thread to reach and execute the `lock` statement will be allowed to update the `_balance`. Any other threads will block until the lock is released.

---

## Locking With Semaphore

The [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>`Semaphore`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.semaphore?view=net-6.0) class is another option we can use to achieve the same effect.

We'll use the `Semaphore` constructor to set the `initialCount` to 0, which means that the `Semaphore` is open at the start. And we will also set the `maximumCount` to 1, which means that only one thread is allowed to enter the `Semaphore`.

Let's see how we can implement the `BankAccount` class using the `Semaphore`:

```cs
public class BankAccount
{
   private static readonly Semaphore _semaphore = new(
      initialCount: 0,
      maximumCount: 1);

   private decimal _balance;

   public void Deposit(decimal amount)
   {
      _semaphore.WaitOne();

      _balance += amount;

      _semaphore.Release();
   }
}
```

To enter the `Semaphore`, we have to call the `WaitOne` method.

If no thread was previously inside, our thread is allowed to enter the `Semaphore` and update the balance.

After updating the balance, we call the `Release` method to release the `Semaphore` for other threads that might be waiting.

---

## Asynchronous Locking With SemaphoreSlim

What if we wanted to call an asynchronous method in a locked context?

We can't use the `lock` statement as it doesn't support asynchronous calls. Awaiting an asynchronous call inside a `lock` statement will cause a compilation error.

The `Semaphore` class can solve this problem.

But I want to show you another option that we have, [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>`SemaphoreSlim`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.semaphoreslim?view=net-6.0). It's a lightweight alternative to the `Semaphore` class and has `async` methods.

Let's see how we can implement the `BankAccount` class using `SemaphoreSlim`:

```cs
public class BankAccount
{
   private static readonly SemaphoreSlim _semaphore = new(
      initialCount: 0,
      maximumCount: 1);

   private decimal _balance;

   public async Task Deposit(decimal amount)
   {
      await _semaphore.WaitAsync();

      _balance += amount;

      _semaphore.Release();
   }
}
```

Notice that I updated the `Deposit` method to return a `Task`.

This time, we're calling `WaitAsync` to block the current thread until it can enter the semaphore.

After updating the balance, we call the `Release` method to release the `SemaphoreSlim` like in the previous example.

## Are There Other Options For Locking in .NET?

So far I mentioned three options to implement locking:

- [`lock` statement](#the-c-lock-statement)
- [`Semaphore`](#locking-with-semaphore)
- [`SemaphoreSlim`](#asynchronous-locking-with-semaphoreslim)

However, **.NET** has other classes for **concurrency control** that you can
explore like [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>`Monitor`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.monitor?view=net-6.0), [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>`Mutex`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.mutex?view=net-6.0), [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-microsoft"/>`ReaderWriterLock`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.readerwriterlock?view=net-6.0) and many more.

I hope you enjoyed this brief introduction to a very complex topic.
