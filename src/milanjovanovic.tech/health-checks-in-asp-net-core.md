We all want to build **robust** and **reliable** applications that can scale indefinitely and handle any number of requests.

But with **distributed systems** and **microservices architectures** growing in complexity, it's becoming increasingly harder to **monitor** the **health** of our applications.

It's vital that you have a system in place to receive quick feedback of your application **health.**

That's where **health checks** come in.

**Health checks** provide a way to monitor and verify the health of various components of an application including:

- Databases
- APIs
- Caches
- External services

Let's see how to implement **health checks** in **ASP.NET Core**.

---

## What Are Health Checks?

**Health checks** are a proactive mechanism for monitoring and verifying the **health** and **availability** of an application in **ASP.NET Core.**

ASP.NET Core has **built-in support** for implementing **health checks.**

Here's the basic configuration, which registers the health check services and adds the `HealthCheckMiddleware` to respond at the specified URL.

```cs{3,7}
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHealthChecks();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapHealthChecks("/health");

app.Run();
```

The health check returns a `HealthStatus` value indicating the health of the service.

There are three distinct `HealthStatus` values:

- `HealthStatus.Healthy`
- `HealthStatus.Degraded`
- `HealthStatus.Unhealthy`

You can use the `HealthStatus` to indicate the different states of your application.

For example, if the application is functioning slower than expected you can return `HealthStatus.Degraded`.

---

## Adding Custom Health Checks

You can create **custom health checks** by implementing the `IHealthCheck` interface.

For example, you can implement a check to see if your **SQL** database is available.

It's important to use a query that can complete quickly in the database, like `SELECT 1`.

Here's a **custom health check** implementation example in the `SqlHealthCheck` class:

```cs
public class SqlHealthCheck : IHealthCheck
{
    private readonly string _connectionString;

    public SqlHealthCheck(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        _connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString("Database");
    }

    public async Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(
        HealthCheckContext context,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        try
        {
            using var sqlConnection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);

            await sqlConnection.OpenAsync(cancellationToken);

            using var command = sqlConnection.CreateCommand();
            command.CommandText = "SELECT 1";

            await command.ExecuteScalarAsync(cancellationToken);

            return HealthCheckResult.Healthy();
        }
        catch(Exception ex)
        {
            return HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy(
                context.Registration.FailureStatus,
                exception: ex);
        }
    }
}
```

After you implement the **custom health check**, you need to register it.

The previous call to `AddHealthChecks` now becomes:

```cs{2}
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddCheck<SqlHealthCheck>("custom-sql", HealthStatus.Unhealthy);
```

We're giving it a custom name and setting which status to use as the failure result in `HealthCheckContext.Registration.FailureStatus`.

But stop and think for a moment.

Do you want to implement a **custom health check** on your own for **every external service** that you have?

Of course not! There's a better solution.

## Using Existing Health Check Libraries

Before you start implementing a custom **health check** for everything, you should first see if there's already an **existing library.**

In the [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks`](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks) repository you can find a wide collection **health check** packages for frequently used services and libraries.

Here are just a few examples:

- <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-sqlserver"/>SQL Server: `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SqlServer`
- <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-postgresql"/>Postgres: `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Npgsql`
- <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-redis"/>Redis: `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Redis`
- <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-rabbitmq"/>RabbitMQ: `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.RabbitMQ`
- <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-aws"/>AWS S3: `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.Aws.S3`
- SignalR: `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.SignalR`

Here's how to add health checks for **PostgreSQL** and **RabbitMQ**:

```cs{3-4}
builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
    .AddCheck<SqlHealthCheck>("custom-sql", HealthStatus.Unhealthy);
    .AddNpgSql(pgConnectionString)
    .AddRabbitMQ(rabbitConnectionString)
```

## Formatting Health Checks Response

By default, the endpoint returning you **health check** status will return a string value representing a `HealthStatus`.

This isn't practical if you have **multiple health checks** configured, as you'd want to view the health status individually per service.

To make matters worse, if one of the services is failing the entire response will return `Unhealthy` and you don't know what's causing the issue.

You can solve this by providing a `ResponsWriter`, and there's an existing one in the `AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI.Client` library.

Let's install the **NuGet** package:

```pwsh
Install-Package AspNetCore.HealthChecks.UI.Client
```

And you need to slightly update the call to `MapHealthChecks` to use the `ResponseWriter` coming from this library:

```cs{3-6}
app.MapHealthChecks(
    "/health",
    new HealthCheckOptions
    {
        ResponseWriter = UIResponseWriter.WriteHealthCheckUIResponse
    });
```

After making these changes, here's what the response from the health check endpoint looks like:

```json
{
  "status": "Unhealthy",
  "totalDuration": "00:00:00.3285211",
  "entries": {
    "npgsql": {
      "data": {},
      "duration": "00:00:00.1183517",
      "status": "Healthy",
      "tags": []
    },
    "rabbitmq": {
      "data": {},
      "duration": "00:00:00.1189561",
      "status": "Healthy",
      "tags": []
    },
    "custom-sql": {
      "data": {},
      "description": "Unable to connect to the database.",
      "duration": "00:00:00.2431813",
      "exception": "Unable to connect to the database.",
      "status": "Unhealthy",
      "tags": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Takeaway

Application monitoring is important to track availability, resource usage, and changes to performance in your application.

I've used **health checks** before to implement **failover scenarios** in a **cloud deployment**. When one application instance stops responding with a healthy result, a new one is created to continue serving requests.

It's easy to monitor the health of your ASP.NET Core applications by **exposing health checks** for your services.

You can decide to implement **custom health checks**, but first consider if there are **existing solutions**.

Thank you for reading, and have an awesome Saturday.
