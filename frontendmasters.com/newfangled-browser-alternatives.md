You’ve got your classic web browsers with the biggest chunks of market share. The [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Statcounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/) website gives us a picture of those with what seems like decent [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>methodology](https://gs.statcounter.com/faq#methodology):

![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-20-at-8.44.12%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C520&ssl=1)

They’ve all got their fans. A bigger influence on these stats is browsers that are pre-installed or built-in to operating systems. Chrome is default on Android. Safari is default on Apple-anything. Edge is default on Windows. Samsung Internet is default on Samsung phones. Firefox is default on some Linux distributions. People tend to leave defaults alone.

But what *else* is out there?

Let’s take a look at browsers with much less than 2% market share. They are based on the open source engines that power these other major browsers (except for a few we’ll mention at the end), but do unique things on top of those engines. It’s an interesting space to watch, as browser software is big business with how many potential users they are, so even niche audiences can build good businesses.

::: note Heads up

Not all of these are particularly *new*, but hey, they might be new to you as some were new to me while poking around at this. I’ve focused here on desktop browsers, although many of them have mobile versions of themselves.

::: tabs

@tab:active Arc

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-20-at-9.00.18%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C934&ssl=1)](https://arc.net/)

Arc is my personal daily driver. I really like it for [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>a bunch of reasons](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/02/11/still-on-arc/#reasons). Turns out I really like the sidebar tab structure, multiple workspaces, split view, and the command bar to name a few. Arc did a great job of showing the world that real UI/UX innovation could happen around browsers while using an existing engine.

But Arc, while still getting updates for engine versions, is largely abandon-ware. I [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>tried switching away](https://diabrowser.com/) (but failed). The company behind it is now working on another browser called [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Dia](https://diabrowser.com/) of which little is known aside from… more AI?

@tab Horse Browser

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-9.40.12%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C904&ssl=1)](https://gethorse.com/)

The big thing with Horse Browser is that your tabs are in a sidebar and *nested.* They call that “Trails”. If that clicks with you, you’ll probably love it. If it doesn’t, there really isn’t any reason to use it.

@tab Zen Browser

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-10.05.38%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C964&ssl=1)](https://zen-browser.app)

Zen Browser is essentially a shameless replica of Arc, only free, [open-source (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`zen-browser`)](https://github.com/zen-browser), and Firefox-based instead of Chrome. Hopefully they can keep up the momentum long term, find a business model, innovate beyond what Arc did, and find a way past the [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>inability to stream stuff](https://docs.zen-browser.app/faq#why-cant-zen-browser-play-drm-protected-content).

@tab Orion

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-11.37.30%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C943&ssl=1)](https://kagi.com/orion/)

From the team at [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Kagi](https://kagi.com/) (the privacy-friendly search engine), this browser also has various privacy-friendly features. Like Horse, it’s going for that nested tabs in a sidebar thing, with new-window based tab groups. Another notable [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>feature](https://blog.kagi.com/orion-features) is that it supports Chrome and Firefox extensions as well as WebKit extensions — which seems entirely unique.

- 💰 Free
- ⚙️ WebKit

@tab Vivaldi

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-11.42.48%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C932&ssl=1)](https://vivaldi.com/)

Vivaldi seems to be able *lots* of features and *lots* of customizability. Put your tabs where ever you want them. Full on theming. There is integrated email, calendars, VPN, and even an RSS reader. With stuff like “command chains” and “mouse gestures”, this is power user focused.

- 💰 Free
- ⚙️ Chromium

@tab Wavebox

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-4.23.20%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1024%2C967&ssl=1)](https://wavebox.io/)

It looks like the big play with Wavebox is that it uses big square icons for your tabs (“apps”) and you can group them together “just like your phone!” with notification badges and such. Then you have profiles you can switch between, so the drive is configuring your own job-specific home bases. Other features like “focus mode” and time tracking make is squarely a “this is for work” browser.

- ⚙️ Chromium

(Not to be confused with [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Wave browser](https://wavebrowser.co/features) which is weirdly similar?)

@tab Surf

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-4.46.05%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1024%2C948&ssl=1)](https://deta.surf/)

I haven’t been able to use their alpha, but from the video on their homepage, the UI looks a lot like Arc. It’s “context” instead of “workspace” and “stuff” instead of “library”. The AI feature where you ask questions based on the open stuff in your context seems straightforward and kinda smart. I like where it gets weird and you build your own sloppy homepage full of random rectangles.

## Shift

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-at-7.04.41%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C915&ssl=1)](https://shift.com/)

Shift is definitely in the category of “browsers are for work, and work is apps, so here’s your apps.” Like many (most?) of these browser alternatives, it has workspaces, which means you can be logged into all those apps with your work accounts, switch workspaces, and be logged into all those same apps with different accounts (like a different client or your personal life or whatever).

## Brave

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-21-at-4.46.38%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1024%2C936&ssl=1)](https://brave.com/)

Brave was launched in 2016 making it likely much older than most of these. It’s one of the big classic alternative browsers and has always been a bit controversial. It’s got a commitment to privacy, but isn’t fully open source and literally [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-brave"/>monetizes through ads](https://brave.com/brave-ads/browser/). It’s got Brendan Eich at the helm who is [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>controversial](https://cbsnews.com/news/mozilla-chief-steps-down-after-controversial-donation-causes-uproar/). It’s gotten into crypto stuff with Basic Attention Tokens, Brave Rewards, and Brave Wallet, and clearly not everyone is hyped on crypto. The UI is nicely polished and certainly has a lot of fans.

## DuckDuckGo Browser

[![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-at-11.03.19%E2%80%AFAM.png?resize=1024%2C934&ssl=1)](https://duckduckgo.com/)

DuckDuckGo itself is a privacy focused search engine using Bing’s search index. It seems the entire browser feature set is focused on privacy/protection and ad blocking (except their own).

## Opera GX

![](https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-2.13.44%E2%80%AFPM.png?resize=1009%2C1024&ssl=1)

Of course there is [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-opera"/>Opera](https://opera.com/), which really used to be one of the main browsers, and sort of lost that distinction when it went Chromium sold and generally got weird (long story). Opera GX is “for gamers” which seems largely aesthetic, but hey, I can’t blame them. Seems like a niche worth serving.

## Other Notable Entries

- [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Polypane](https://polypane.app/) isn’t intended to be a daily driver style of browser, but it is a browser that is designed for web developers and has tons of cool features specifically for that.
- If you’re specifically interesting in privacy-focused browsers where the feature set is largely “more privacy”, you’ve got:
  - [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/#what-is-librewolf)
  - [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Waterfox](https://waterfox.net/)

Very notable are the organizations trying to make entirely new browser engines, and browsers on top of them. Those are:

- [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Ladybird](https://arc.net/l/quote/gckrvndn)
- [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Flow](https://ekioh.com/flow-browser/)
