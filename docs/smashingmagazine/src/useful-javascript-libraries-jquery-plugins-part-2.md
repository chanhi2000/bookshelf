In this two-part overview, we feature some of the most useful JavaScript and jQuery libraries which could be just the right solutions for your common problems. We hope that this overview will help you find or rediscover some tools that you could use in your next projects.

If you have a problem and need a solution for it, chances are high that a JavaScript library or jQuery plugin exists that was created to solve this very problem. Such libraries are always great to have in your bookmarks or in your local folders, especially if you aren’t a big fan of cross-browser debugging.

In this overview, we feature **some of the recent useful JavaScript and jQuery libraries** which could be just the right solutions for your common problems. You might know some of these libraries, but you probably don’t know most of them. In either case, we hope that this overview will help you find or rediscover some tools that you could use in your next projects.

Due to the length of this post, we’ve split it into two parts for your convenience:

[Relevancy.js (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github" />`padolsey/relevancy.js`)](https://github.com/padolsey/relevancy.js) This library allows you to sort an array of items based on their relevancy. This script is attempting to implement basic partial matching which so far has not been successfully implemented. It assigns strings to their respective elements.

### Manipulating Tables And Lists

Handsontables: Excel-Like Tables For The Web This jQuery library allows you to use auto-expanding and auto-complete as well as add new rows and columns. It also includes a legend, scrolling (so as your table grows, it won’t take up your entire page and become unwieldy), context menus, conditional formatting and other features. You can even set it to track changes made to the table. And, all the data you enter in Handsontable can be copied and pasted to Excel, Google Spreadsheet, or LibreOffice.

![JavaScript Library](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a90cb865-0016-4ba6-a429-1d32fb9ef588/handsontable.jpg)

<SiteInfo

~~[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Create Nested Sortable Lists With jQuery](https://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable/) This plugin lets you create a sortable list where your users can drag and drop list items into any configuration they choose. You can set various attributes, such as the maximum number of nested levels, as well as setting custom methods (including To hierarchy, To array, and Serialize). As an alternative, there’s also the [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>HTML5 Sortable](https://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable/) plugin, which uses HTML5 and jQuery for a similar functionality.~~

![JavaScript Library](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9f60faba-409e-46a4-a34c-130fe04d2052/html5sortable.jpg)

Pivot.js With Pivot you can easily summarize large data sets on the fly. The library lets you create customizable table views from your browser. The results of pivot-table tools (which automatically sort, count, total or give the average) will be displayed as an HTML table pivoting from the input data (CSV or JSON).

![Pivot.js](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/39a2e25e-d995-46f0-99dd-c25f6c486990/pivotjs.jpg)

~~[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Crossfilter](https://square.github.com/crossfilter/) Crossfilter is a JavaScript library which supports exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. It enables fast (<30ms) interaction with coordinated views, even with large data sets containing more than a million records. It was built to power analytics for Square Register and allows merchants to slice and dice their payment history fluidly. By using sorted indexes, the library speeds up incremental filtering and thereby increases the performance of live histograms and top-K lists.~~

![Crossfilter](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/08d143bd-af81-40c8-8e86-4b9a76aed7bd/crossfilter.jpg)

~~[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Csonv.js](https://archan937.github.com/csonv.js/) Paul Engel has released a tiny library to fetch relational CSV data client-side (JSON). When using CSV, one file represents one entity; the librarycan also nest relational data within the resulting objects as if you are joining SQL tables.~~

It effectively uses plugins like NodeJS, Compass, Grunt and PhantomJS and actually requires the installation of Node 0.8.x.

![JavaScript Library](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ed15e0df-ee3c-4260-821b-a1fe58c40751/yeoman.png)

[<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-grunt"/>Grunt.js: Task-Based Command Line Tool](https://gruntjs.com/) Grunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects. It has a dozen of predefined tasks built-in already: file concatenation, project scaffolding from a predefined template, validation with JSHint, minifcation with UglifyJS, qUnit tests, server start, running unit tests with nodeunit and running watched files.

![Grunt.js: Task-Based Command Line Tool](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/12c9eb9a-2db1-463b-a657-cca0e87f775e/grunt-cmd1.jpg)

~~[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Holder.js](https://imsky.github.com/holder/) A client-side image placeholder library to render placeholders entirely in browser. It works both online and offline, and offers a chainable API to style and create placeholders with ease. You can use Holder in different areas on different images with custom themes. Since it extends its default settings with the settings you provide, you only have to include those settings which you want changed.~~

![Holder.js](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/116bce54-084a-4baa-b047-5f8832860a47/js-libraries-107.jpg)

[Resumable.js (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github" />`23/resumable.js`)](https://github.com/23/resumable.js) The library is designed to introduce fault-tolerance into the upload of large files through HTTP. It thus provides multiple, simultaneous and resumable uploads through the HTML5 File API. That means, losing the networks connection doesn’t require a completely new upload. Users can also manage their uploads without loss of data. However, due to the reliance on the HTML5 File API, support is currently limited to Firefox 4+ and Chrome 11+.

[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Filer.js](https://ericbidelman.tumblr.com/post/14866798359/introducing-filer-js) Eric Bidelman released a wrapper library for the HTML5 Filesystem API. Filer.js reuses familiar UNIX commands and makes the HTML5 API more approachable for developers that have done file I/O in other languages. Repetitive operations (renaming, moving, duplicating) are easier to manage. You might want to check out [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>DownloadBuilder.js](https://gregfranko.com/DownloadBuilder.js/), a library that supports concatenation of local files and uses session storage to cache Ajax/JSONP requests.

[Client Side Caching For JavaScript (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github" />`d0ugal/locache`)](https://github.com/d0ugal/locache) Server caching is useful for quick response times, but sometimes, especially when you are developing a Web application, you migh need to cache objects client-side rather than server-side. Maybe you need to cache something for offline use, or for reuse later. That’s where [locache.js (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github" />`d0ugal/locache`)](https://github.com/d0ugal/locache) comes in. It’s a JavaScript caching framework for client side caching in the browser using HTML5 local storage. The library has a memcache-similar API, no dependencies and is very small. And the best part: locache gracefully degrades when the browser doesn’t support local storage. So users with IE6 and IE7 will not get any errors, but as developers say, “caching attempts will be silently dropped and lookups will always appear to be a cache miss.” You can provide an expiration time for cached objects as well.
