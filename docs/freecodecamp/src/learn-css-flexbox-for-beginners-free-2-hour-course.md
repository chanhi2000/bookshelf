Flexbox is a powerful CSS feature that lets you build user interfaces that fit any screen size. freeCodeCamp just published a Flexbox for beginners course where you'll learn the concepts and code syntax by building your own website navigation bar.

If you’ve ever struggled to center something with CSS or tried to make columns line up nicely, Flexbox simplifies this dramatically. With just a few properties, you can build modern layouts that “flex” to different screen sizes, without needing to write a bunch of custom media queries.

Developer and teacher [Indra (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>`@CodeWithIndra`)](https:/youtube.com/@CodeWithIndra) will walk you through every Flexbox property step by step. You’ll learn how to align items along the main and cross axis, reorder elements without changing the HTML, control how items grow and shrink, and finally understand what flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis are really doing. He also shows real examples from sites like GitHub and DataDog, then demonstrates how to recreate pieces of their layout.

The course ends with two small projects: centering an element vertically and horizontally (the thing everyone Googles at some point) and building a clean navigation bar using only Flexbox.

If you want to improve your front end development skills, this course is a good way to invest a couple hours of your weekend. [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>2 hour YouTube course](https://youtu.be/nbsz6muQRT4):
