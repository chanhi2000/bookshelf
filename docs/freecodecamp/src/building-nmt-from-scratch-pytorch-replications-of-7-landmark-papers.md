Learn about the complete neural machine translation journey.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is a comprehensive journey through the evolution of sequence models and neural machine translation (NMT). It blends historical breakthroughs, architectural innovations, mathematical insights, and hands-on PyTorch replications of landmark papers that shaped modern NLP and AI.

The course features:

- A detailed narrative tracing the history and breakthroughs of RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Seq2Seq, Attention, GNMT, and Multilingual NMT.
- Replications of 7 landmark NMT papers in PyTorch, so learners can code along and rebuild history step by step.
- Explanations of the math behind RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers.
- Conceptual clarity with architectural comparisons, visual explanations, and interactive demos like the Transformer Playground.

Here are all the sections in the course:

- Evolution of RNN
- Evolution of Machine Translation
- Machine Translation Techniques
- Long Short-Term Memory (Overview)
- Learning Phrase Representation using RNN (Encoder–Decoder for SMT)
- Learning Phrase Representation (PyTorch Lab – Replicating Cho et al., 2014)
- Seq2Seq Learning with Neural Networks
- Seq2Seq (PyTorch Lab – Replicating Sutskever et al., 2014)
- NMT by Jointly Learning to Align (Bahdanau et al., 2015)
- NMT by Jointly Learning to Align & Translate (PyTorch Lab – Replicating Bahdanau et al., 2015)
- On Using Very Large Target Vocabulary
- Large Vocabulary NMT (PyTorch Lab – Replicating Jean et al., 2015)
- Effective Approaches to Attention (Luong et al., 2015)
- Attention Approaches (PyTorch Lab – Replicating Luong et al., 2015)
- Long Short-Term Memory Network (Deep Explanation)
- Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al., 2017)
- Google Neural Machine Translation System (GNMT – Wu et al., 2016)
- GNMT (PyTorch Lab – Replicating Wu et al., 2016)
- Google’s Multilingual NMT (Johnson et al., 2017)
- Multilingual NMT (PyTorch Lab – Replicating Johnson et al., 2017)
- Transformer vs GPT vs BERT Architectures
- Transformer Playground (Tool Demo)
- Seq2Seq Idea from Google Translate Tool
- RNN, LSTM, GRU Architectures (Comparisons)
- LSTM & GRU Equations
