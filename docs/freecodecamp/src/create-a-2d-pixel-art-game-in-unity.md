Learn how to build a complete 2D Pixel Art Tower Defense game in Unity from scratch!

We just posted a step-by-step tutorial on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will guide you from a blank project to a fully playable game with a main menu, multiple tower types, enemy waves, and three unique levels. Frank from Frank’s Laboratory developed this course.

You’ll learn how to create a modular, data-driven system using Scriptable Objects to manage towers, enemies, and waves, plus how to design forest, lava, and jungle levels with Unity Tilemaps.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn:

- How to set up 2D Tilemap levels in Unity
- Animate pixel-art characters
- Build towers and spawn enemy waves
- Design diverse game worlds with Tilemaps
- Export builds for Windows, Android, and Web
- Publish and share your game online

Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/dSIVVX0vAsY) (10-hour watch).
