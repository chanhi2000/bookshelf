## Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)

![CEH](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1761892973456/f8c760ae-734e-4420-8961-d41a931458cc.jpeg)

The [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>CEH certification](https://eccouncil.org/train-certify/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/), offered by EC-Council, is one of the most recognized credentials for those who want to specialize in ethical hacking and penetration testing. It teaches you how to think like a hacker, identify vulnerabilities, and secure systems before attackers can exploit them.

CEH covers topics such as footprinting, scanning, enumeration, system hacking, web application hacking, and social engineering. The goal is to understand the attacker’s mindset so you can defend more effectively. It also includes hands-on labs that allow you to practice hacking techniques in a controlled environment.

This certification is often the first step for many cybersecurity professionals who want to move into roles such as penetration tester, red team member, or security analyst. It demonstrates that you know how to identify weaknesses and apply countermeasures to protect systems and data. Since it’s a beginner certification, there are often questions whether [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>CEH is worth taking](https://eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/is-ceh-worth-it/). But it is still the most widely known cybersecurity certification in existence.

Employers value CEH because it bridges the gap between theory and practice. While it’s not as advanced as some other certifications, it provides a solid foundation for anyone interested in offensive security. If you are looking to start a career in ethical hacking or penetration testing, CEH is an excellent choice.
