The "liminal space" aesthetic of the Backrooms has become a staple of modern indie horror. If you’ve ever wanted to create your own unsettling, claustrophobic experience, the latest course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel is your perfect starting point.

In this comprehensive tutorial from DevEdge Studio, you’ll learn how to build a complete Backrooms-style horror game from scratch using Unreal Engine 5. And it is created entirely using Blueprints, meaning you don’t need to write a single line of C++ code to create the game.

Thought In this project, you will develop a fully playable "Body Cam" style horror game. You’ll build a complete gameplay loop featuring intelligent enemy AI, interactive puzzles, and custom jump scares, all while utilizing Blueprint Interfaces. And then at the end you will package a polished, standalone .exe file ready for distribution.

Watch the full course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/2Kw3e-1vbBQ) (3-hour watch).
