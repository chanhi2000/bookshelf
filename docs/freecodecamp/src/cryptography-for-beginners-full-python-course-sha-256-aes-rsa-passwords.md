We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about cryptography. You'll learn essential techniques like hashing (SHA-256) for verifying file integrity, symmetric encryption (AES), and asymmetric encryption (RSA) using public and private keys. The practical focus of the tutorial involves building a fully functional command-line cryptography tool in Python. Upon completion, you'll have a complete practical toolkit and the skills to safeguard data, secure passwords, and deter tampering.

This course was developed by Thanishkka. She is part of Hack Club. Hack Club is a global non-profit organization that creates a community for high school students interested in coding and making things with technology.

Here are the sections in the course:

- Introduction: What is Cryptography?
- About Hack Club and the Course Creator
- Cryptography Basics & Cybershe Demo
- Three Main Areas: Hashing, Symmetric, and Asymmetric Encryption
- Deep Dive into Hashing (SHA 256) and File Integrity
- Symmetric Encryption with AES (Key, IV, and Modes)
- Asymmetric Encryption with RSA (Public and Private Keys)
- Setup: Python and VS Code Installation
- Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment
- Installing Required Python Libraries (cryptography, zxcvbn, bcrypt)
- Coding the File Hashing Function (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`hash.py`)
- Coding the File Integrity Verification Function
- Coding AES Symmetric Encryption/Decryption (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`encryption.py`)
- Coding RSA Asymmetric Encryption/Decryption
- Coding the Password Strength Checker (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`password.py`)
- Coding Password Hashing and Verification (using bcrypt)
- Building the Command Line UI (<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`main.py`)
- Final Toolkit Demo and Testing
- Conclusion and Next Steps

Watch the full course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/kb_scuDUHls) (1-hour watch).
