We just posted a Kubernetes Operator course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. You will learn how to extend Kubernetes by building your own custom operators and controllers from scratch. You’ll go beyond simply using Kubernetes and start treating it as a Software Development Kit (SDK).

You will learn how to build a real-world operator that manages AWS EC2 instances directly from Kubernetes, covering everything from the internal architecture of Informers and Caches to advanced concepts like Finalizers and Idempotency.

The course is broken up into six parts:

- Part 1: The Theory of Controllers
- Part 2: Kubernetes Extensibility
- Part 3: Setting Up the Environment
- Part 4: Building the API & Logic
- Part 5: Hands-on Development
- Part 6: Advanced Internals & Deployment

Watch the full course [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/watch?v=odP153inZUo) (6-hour watch).
