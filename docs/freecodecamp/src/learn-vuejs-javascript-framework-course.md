Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. Loved for its simplicity, flexibility, and performance, it allows developers to start small and scale up to complex applications with ease. Whether you’re creating quick prototypes or production-ready projects, Vue’s approachable syntax and strong community make it an excellent tool to have in your toolkit.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you Vue as you build real projects, dive into its core features, and create dynamic, reusable, and reactive apps with ease. Rachel Johnson from Scrimba developed this course.

The course is divided into two sections. Here is what is covered in each section.

**Section 1:**

- Learn what Vue is and why it’s so popular
- Get set up with both CDN and local installs
- Create your first apps
- Explore the structure of a Vue project so you know where everything lives

**Section 2:**

- Work with Vue’s core building blocks: components, reactivity, template syntax
- Handle images and assets
- Split your app into reusable parts
- Bind data dynamically
- Display content that updates instantly
- A simple Vue Facts app

Watch the full course [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/Kt2E8nblvXU) (2-hour watch).
