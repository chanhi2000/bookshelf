Supabase is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides developers with a powerful set of tools to build applications quickly.

This comprehensive video tutorial introduces you to Supabase by building a real-world React.js Sales Dashboard app with authentication, real-time data operations, and secure user management.

The app features user authentication with role-based access along with a visualization of aggregated sales deals for each rep, updating in real-time as new deals are added. You’ll also build scalable user profiles which are automatically created upon signup using database triggers, and secure all data with permission-based filtering. By the end, you’ll have a production-ready business application with proper user management, data visualization, and security.

Here are the topics covered in this course:

**Database & Schema Design**

- Create Supabase projects with multiple related tables
- Design user profiles with account type categorization
- Set up database triggers for automated data population

**Authentication & Session Management**

- Configure Supabase Auth for user signup and sign in/out
- Handle user sessions and JWT authentication
- Connect authenticated users to their profiles

**Data Operations & Real-time Features**

- Query databases to fetch and display data
- Aggregate sales data for visualization
- Create bar chart visualizations of deals by rep
- Insert new records via forms
- Set up Realtime subscriptions for live chart updates
