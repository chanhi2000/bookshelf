SwiftData’s default delete rule for relationships is `.nullify`, which means for example that if you have an `School` object with many `Student` objects as a relationship, then deleting the school will leave the students intact in your data store. That might make sense in some places, but you can also specify a `.cascade` delete rule, meaning that all related objects will be deleted when the parent object is deleted. 

::: tip

If you have multi-tier relations with cascade delete rules, SwiftData will continue deleting all the way down.

:::

For example, if you have a `House` model with an array of `Room` objects, it would make sense to delete all the rooms when the house is deleted.

There are two ways of writing this. When dealing with a cascade delete rule, the smartest and simplest approach is to specify the inverse relationship by hand, allowing us to make one side of the relationship non-optional, like this:

```swift
@Model
class House {
    var address: String
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Room.house) var rooms: [Room]

    init(address: String, rooms: [Room] = []) {
        self.address = address
        self.rooms = rooms
    }
}

@Model
class Room {
    var house: House
    var name: String

    init(house: House, name: String) {
        self.house = house
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

If you’d prefer to have SwiftData infer the inverse relationship for you, you should skip the `inverse` parameter for your relationship then make the other property optional, like this:

```swift
@Model
class House {
    var address: String
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var rooms: [Room]

    init(address: String, rooms: [Room] = []) {
        self.address = address
        self.rooms = rooms
    }
}

@Model
class Room {
    var house: House?
    var name: String

    init(house: House?, name: String) {
        self.house = house
        self.name = name
    }
}
```

Remember, the name “cascade delete” means that multi-level relationships automatically delete all the way down the chain. For example, if we said that a school has many students and each student has many exam results, then gave each of those relationships a cascade delete rule, then deleting the school would delete all the students and all their exam results in one go.

Here’s how that looks in Swift:

```swift
@Model
class School {
    var name: String
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \Student.school) var students: [Student]

    init(name: String, students: [Student] = []) {
        self.name = name
        self.students = students
    }
}

@Model
class Student {
    var name: String
    var school: School
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade) var results: [Result]

    init(name: String, school: School, results: [Result] = []) {
        self.name = name
        self.school = school
        self.results = results
    }
}

@Model
class Result {
    var subject: String
    var grade: Int

    init(subject: String, grade: Int) {
        self.subject = subject
        self.grade = grade
    }
}
```
