If you want to delete and destroy all SwiftData objects - every instance of every model belonging to a specific container - you might think you should should call the `deleteAllData()` of `ModelContainer`. However, that is quite unhelpful as of iOS 17.0: the method call succeeds, but all that happens is SwiftData disconnects from its underlying data store with your data being unchanged - next time you create the same container it will all be back.

::: important

I’m saying that again for folks who think skim reading is cool: at the time of writing `deleteAllData()` won’t do what you expect.

:::

Instead, you need to call the `delete(model:)` method of your model context once for each model type you have, without providing any predicate that would otherwise limit which objects are destroyed.

For example, if you use `Country` and `City` models, you’d use this:

```swift
do {
    try modelContext.delete(model: Country.self)
    try modelContext.delete(model: City.self)
} catch {
    print("Failed to clear all Country and City data.")
}
```

This doesn’t strictly reset your model container completely, however: all the table definitions and other data will be intact, they’ll just be empty.
