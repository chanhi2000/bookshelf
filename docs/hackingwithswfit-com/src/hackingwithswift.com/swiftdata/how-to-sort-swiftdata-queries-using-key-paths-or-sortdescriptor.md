Sorting SwiftData queries is either done with a key path for simple sorts, or an array of `SortDescriptor` for more complex sorts. Some query variants - e.g. creating a `FetchDescriptor` by hand - only support the array approach, whereas using `@Query` supports both.

For the simplest approach using `@Query`, you can specify your sort order as a key path on the model you’re querying. So, if we had a `Movie` model, we could load all movies sorted alphabetically by their name like this:

```swift
@Query(sort: \Movie.name) var movies: [Movie]
```

And if you wanted a *descending* alphabetical sort, we’d use this:

```swift
@Query(sort: \Movie.name, order: .reverse) var movies: [Movie]
```

You can even dig into relationship data, for example sorting by the name of a movie’s director:

```swift
@Query(sort: \Movie.director.name) var movies: [Movie]
```

This sort key path can be any directly comparable property of your model, so we could sort by movie name, movie release date, director age, or anything similar.

::: important

Although you can make your models conform to `Comparable` and use them in these sort orders, it will not work as intended. Behind the scenes SwiftData will insert your model to its own table with a primary key integer, then sort *by that integer* - you’re effectively sorting by when each object was inserted into your context.

:::

To get more advanced sorting, you can specify an array of `SortDescriptor`. This approach works much the same with both `@Query` and `FetchDescriptor`, which does make life a little easier. The advantage of this approach is that you can specify multiple sort orders to have them applied in order: if the first two fields sort the same for two objects, then they are sorted by the second field, then the third, and so on.

For example, we could sort a list of movies alphabetically, then release date reverse, then finally by director name:

```swift
@Query(sort: [SortDescriptor(\name), SortDescriptor(\Movie.releaseDate, order: .reverse), SortDescriptor(\Movie.director.name)]) var movies: [Movie]
```

There are lots of movies called “The Awakening” (over 30!), and it’s not *impossible* to have two movies with the same name and same release date, but it would be supremely unlikely to have name, release date, *and* director name all be the same.

As I said, this same approach works great with a standalone `FetchDescriptor`, although here the type inference for key paths works a little better so we can skip the model name:

```swift
var descriptor = FetchDescriptor<Movie>(sortBy: [SortDescriptor(\.name)])
let results = (try? modelContext.fetch(descriptor)) ?? []
```
