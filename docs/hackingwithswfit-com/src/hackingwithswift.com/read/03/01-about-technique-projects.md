As you should know, this series follows the order app, game, technique. Project 1 was an app letting users browse images on their phone, project 2 was a game that lets players guess flags, so now it's time for the first technique project.

The goal with technique projects is to pick out one iOS technology and focus on it in depth. Some will be easy, some others not so much, but I promise to try to keep them as short as possible because I know you want to focus on making real things.

This first technique project is going to be really simple, because we're going to modify project 1 to do something it doesn't currently do: allow users to share images with their friends.
