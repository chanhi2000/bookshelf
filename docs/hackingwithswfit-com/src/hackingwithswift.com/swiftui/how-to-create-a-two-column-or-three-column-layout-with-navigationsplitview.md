Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated in iOS 16**

SwiftUI's `NavigationSplitView` allows us to create multi-column layouts on larger devices (iPadOS, macOS, and large iPhones in landscape), but automatically collapses to a `NavigationStack`-style layout when space is limited.

In its simplest form, you should provide your sidebar as its first trailing closure, and your detail view as its second, like this:

```swift
NavigationSplitView {
    Text("Sidebar")
} detail: {
    Text("Detail View")
}
```

Usually, though, you'll want to add some kind of selection mechanism to the sidebar, then load that selection in the detail view, like this:

```swift
NavigationSplitView {
    List(1..<50) { i in
        NavigationLink("Row \(i)", value: i)
    }
    .navigationDestination(for: Int.self) {
        Text("Selected row \($0)")
    }
    .navigationTitle("Split View")
} detail: {
    Text("Please select a row")
}
```

In that code, the “Please select a row” text is shown only when the user has yet to make a selection in the sidebar, but it will automatically be replaced when the user makes a selection - the `navigationDestination()` modifier displays its destination view in the detail area automatically. Even better, when space is limited you'll see the whole thing flattens down to a regular `NavigationStack`, so you get the best of both worlds.

If you want to go further, `NavigationSplitView` allows us to add a *third* view to its layout, which can be shown with a button tap:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView {
            Text("Sidebar")
        } content: {
            Text("Primary View")
        } detail: {
            Text("Detail View")
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI will automatically take care of showing a button to slide in your bar from the side of the screen, and also collapse it with your primary view if you're in a compact size class.

If you're targeting iPadOS 15 or earlier, you can get a sidebar by placing three views inside a `NavigationView`, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Text("Sidebar")
            Text("Primary View")
            Text("Detail View")
        }
    }
}
```

If you're presenting a list inside an iPadOS 15 sidebar, it's a good idea to use the `.listStyle()` to give it the system-standard theme for sidebars, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List(1..<100) { i in
            Text("Row \(i)")
        }
        .listStyle(.sidebar)
    }
}
```
