If you have one SwiftUI view inside another, and both have the same gesture recognizer, the system will always trigger the recognizer on the child before the parent. You can change this behavior by using `highPriorityGesture()`, which will force the system to prioritize one gesture over another.

For example, we could write some code to place a circle inside a `VStack`, giving both a simple tap gesture action. In this situation the circle's gesture action will always be triggered:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(.red)
                .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
                .onTapGesture {
                    print("Circle tapped")
                }
        }
        .onTapGesture {
            print("VStack tapped")
        }
    }
}
```

If you want the `VStack` gesture to be triggered in place of the circle's, you need to replace the `onTapGesture()` modifier with `highPriorityGesture()` like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Circle()
                .fill(.red)
                .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
                .onTapGesture {
                    print("Circle tapped")
                }
        }
        .highPriorityGesture(
            TapGesture()
                .onEnded { _ in
                    print("VStack tapped")
                }
        )
    }
}
```

<VidStack src="https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-force-one-gesture-to-recognize-before-another-using-highprioritygesture-2~dark.mp4" />

Using this alternative, “VStack tapped” will always be printed because the `VStack` recognizer will always take priority over the circle's.
