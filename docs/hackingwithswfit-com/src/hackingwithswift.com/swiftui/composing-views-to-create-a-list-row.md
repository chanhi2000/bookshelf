Just having names of menu items written out isn't particularly appealing for a restaurant, so let's make those items look good.

First, though, an important lesson: SwiftUI is designed to be _composable_, which means you can make views out of any other views you like. We have a simple text view for our items right now, `Text(item.name)`, but we're going to add much more in there to bring it to life. While we _could_ put that directly into <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift`, it becomes long and hard to read.

A better idea is to make a new view type that we can embed _inside_ `ContentView`, and SwiftUI is designed to make this both easy (it takes only 30 seconds to learn) and extremely fast (it has almost zero performance impact).

So, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> to create a new file, choose SwiftUI View under the User Interface category, then call it “ItemRow”. You'll see Xcode has generated a new view with some sample code to get us started:

```swift
struct ItemRow: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World!")
    }
}
```

We're going to be doing something new in just a moment, but first I want to get us to the point where we are using `ItemRow` in our code. This means we need to add a `MenuItem` property to `ItemRow`, then use it in its body, like this:

```swift
struct ItemRow : View {
    let item: MenuItem

    var body: some View {
        Text(item.name)
    }
}
```

Now we can go back to <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift` and replace `Text(item.name)` with this:

```swift
ItemRow(item: item)
```

As you can see, that will create new `ItemRow` for each item in our menu section, which in turn will have some text inside.

Now, our code won't build right now, because there's a problem in <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ItemRow.swift`. This code is invalid:

```swift
struct ItemRow_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ItemRow()
    }
}
```

That is SwiftUI's previewing code, which is what allows it show live previews while we work. It's trying to create an `ItemRow` without a menu item attached, which isn't possible. If you really wanted to preview individual rows you could do so by instantiating a copy of our full menu and passing in an example item, but in this instance I've provided an example item for us so we have something to look at.

Change the code to this to make it all work again:

```swift
struct ItemRow_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ItemRow(item: MenuItem.example)
    }
}
```

Once that's done our code will build again, and if you return back to <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift` you should see the same preview we had before - nothing has changed. Of course, now we can start to add new things to that `ItemRow` struct to make it more interesting!

In `ItemRow`, we're going to start by placing the item's thumbnail image and name side by side, like you'd normally see in a `UITableViewCell`. Try writing this:

```swift
var body: some View {
    Image(item.thumbnailImage)
    Text(item.name)
}
```

You'll find that Xcode's preview does something quite strange: you'll see a thumbnail image appear, but no text for the item's name - how come one but not both?

Well, what's happening here is that `some View` means we will return one specific view from our method - not two different views, and certainly not no views at all. When you try and return two views like this, Swift automatically wraps them up in a single, hidden container called a _tuple view_, but without any further instructions on how to display this SwiftUI just picks the first view.

To fix this we need to put those two views inside a container, which in our case will be a `HStack`. This is a container that places its child views side by side horizontally, which is perfect for our needs.

So, try this instead:

```swift
var body: some View {
    HStack {
        Image(item.thumbnailImage)
        Text(item.name)
    }
}
```

If you wanted to put the item's price next to its name, you might try something like this:

```swift
HStack {
    Image(item.thumbnailImage)
    Text(item.name)
    Text("$\(item.price)")
}
```

However, that will put the price to the right of the name, which isn't great. What we usually want here is the kind of subtitle style that we get from `UITableViewCell`, where we can have an image on the left, and on the right have a title above a detail label.

We can achieve that with another stack, called a `VStack` - a _vertical_ stack. This can go inside our existing `HStack` to create the hierarchy we want:

```swift
HStack {
    Image(item.thumbnailImage)

    VStack {
        Text(item.name)
        Text("$\(item.price)")
    }
}
```

You'll notice that our item name and price are centered. That happens because it's the default behavior of `VStack`, but a left alignment would look much better here. We can get that by asking for a leading alignment when creating the `VStack`, like this:

```swift
VStack(alignment: .leading) {
    Text(item.name)
    Text("$\(item.price)")
}
```

If you head back to <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift`, your SwiftUI preview should update so you can see how the full list looks now - much better, I think!
