> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `Slider` view works much like `UISlider`, although you need to bind it somewhere so you can store its value.

When you create it there are a variety of parameters you can provide, but the ones you probably care about most are:

- Value: What Double to bind it to.
- In: The range of the slider.
- Step: How much to change the value when you move the slider. This parameter is optional.

For example, this code creates a slider bound to a `Celsius` property, then updates a text view as the slider moves so that it converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var celsius: Double = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Slider(value: $celsius, in: -100...100)
            Text("\(celsius, specifier: "%.1f") Celsius is \(celsius * 9 / 5 + 32, specifier: "%.1f") Fahrenheit")
        }
    }
}
```
