> Updated for Xcode 15

The `padding()` modifier lets us add some spacing around a view, and the `background()` modifier lets us set a background color. However, the way you use them matters, so it’s important to be clear about your goal in order to get the best results.

As an example, this creates a text view with a red background and white foreground, then adds system default padding to it:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .background(.red)
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
    .padding()
```

And this adds system default padding then sets a red background color and a white foreground:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .padding()
    .background(.red)
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
```

Those two pieces of code might look similar, but they yield different results because the order in which you apply modifiers matters. In the second example the view is padded *then* colored, which means the padding also gets colored red. In contrast, the first example colors then pads, so the padding remains uncolored.

So, if you want some text to have a background color wider than the text itself, make sure to use the second code example - pad *then* color.
