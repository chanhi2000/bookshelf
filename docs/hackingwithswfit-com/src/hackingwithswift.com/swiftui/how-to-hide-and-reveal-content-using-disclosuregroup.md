> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI has a dedicated `DisclosureGroup` view that presents a disclosure indicator and contains content inside. In its simplest form it can be controlled entirely by the user, but you can also bind it to a Boolean property to determine programmatically whether its content is currently visible or not.

For example, this creates a `DisclosureGroup` with lots of text inside:

```swift
DisclosureGroup("Show Terms") {
    Text("Long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here.")
}
.frame(width: 300)
```

If you wanted to track whether the disclosure group was opened or not, bind it to a Boolean like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var revealDetails = false

    var body: some View {
        DisclosureGroup("Show Terms", isExpanded: $revealDetails) {
            Text("Long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here long terms and conditions here.")
        }
        .frame(width: 300)
    }
}
```

You can of course modify the Boolean's state programmatically to control whether the group is expanded or not.
