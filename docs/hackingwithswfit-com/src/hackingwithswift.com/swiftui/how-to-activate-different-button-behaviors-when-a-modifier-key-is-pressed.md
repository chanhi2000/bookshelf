> Updated for Xcode 16

**New in macOS 15**

macOS often shows different button actions when the user holds down modifiers such as Command or Option, and we can get this in our own apps using the `modifierKeyAlternate()` modifier.

Attach this modifier to a button, specifying which modifiers to watch for, and also what to show when those keys are pressed.

For example, we might make a button that shows a regular amount of detail normally, but when Option is held down it shows some extra detail:

```swift
Button("Show Details") {
    print("Regular button action")
}
.modifierKeyAlternate(.option) {
    Button("Show Verbose Details") {
        print("Hold down Option to see this")
    }
}
```

For extra power, you can use multiple `modifierKeyAlternate()` modifiers to add different behaviors to different keys, or specify an array of keys to watch for several at once:

```swift
Button("Show Details") {
    print("Regular button action")
}
.modifierKeyAlternate([.option]) {
    Button("Show Verbose Details") {
        print("Hold down option to see this")
    }
}
.modifierKeyAlternate([.command, .option]) {
    Button("Show Maximum Details") {
        print("Hold down Command and Option to see this")
    }
}
```
