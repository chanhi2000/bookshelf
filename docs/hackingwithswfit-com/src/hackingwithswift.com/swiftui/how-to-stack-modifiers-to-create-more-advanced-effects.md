> Updated for Xcode 15

Each modifier you add to a view adjusts whatever came before it, and you’re able to repeat modifiers more than once.

For example, we could add padding and a background color around a text view, then add some more padding and a different background color, then add some *more* padding and a *third* background color, all to make a particular effect:

```swift
Text("Forecast: Sun")
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
    .padding()
    .background(.red)
    .padding()
    .background(.orange)
    .padding()
    .background(.yellow)
```

This is particularly useful for things like shadows, where you can create stronger shadow effects by repeating them as often as you need.
