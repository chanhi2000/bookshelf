SwiftUI's `layoutPriority()` modifier lets us request that certain views should be given more room on the screen when space is limited. All views have a layout priority of 0 by default, but if you're finding one particular view is squashed you can ask it to be given a higher priority using `layoutPriority()`.

As an example, here are two pieces of text laid out side by side:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Text("The rain Spain falls mainly on the Spaniards.")
            Text("Knowledge is power, France is bacon.")
        }
        .font(.largeTitle)
    }
}
```

Both text strings are long enough that they will wrap across two lines on an iPhone, and SwiftUI will try to size them fairly so they each get a fair amount of space depending on their length.

We can use the `layoutPriority()` modifier to change this by making one of the two strings more important. SwiftUI will calculate the minimum amount of space required for the low-priority text view, then offer the remaining space to the higher-priority text so it can take up as much as it wants.

Here's how that looks:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Text("The rain Spain falls mainly on the Spaniards.")
            Text("Knowledge is power, France is bacon.")
                .layoutPriority(1)
        }
        .font(.largeTitle)
    }
}
```

![Two sentences arranged side by side. The left sentence is wrapped over four lines, the right sentence is displayed in one long line.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-control-layout-priority-using-layoutpriority-2~dark.png)

Obviously the result of that depends on what size screen you're using, but it's likely the higher-priority text view won't use all the available space it was offered, and so the remainder will be given to the lower-priority text view to use.
