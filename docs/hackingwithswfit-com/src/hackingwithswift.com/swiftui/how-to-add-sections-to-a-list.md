> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI's list view has built-in support for sections and section headers, just like `UITableView` in UIKit. To add a section around some cells, start by placing a `Section` around it, optionally also adding a header and footer.

As an example, we could create a row that holds task data for a reminders app, then create a list view that has two sections: one for important tasks and one for less important tasks.

Here's how that looks:

```swift
struct TaskRow: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Task data goes here")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            Section(header: Text("Important tasks")) {
                TaskRow()
                TaskRow()
                TaskRow()
            }

            Section(header: Text("Other tasks")) {
                TaskRow()
                TaskRow()
                TaskRow()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You can also add footer text to sections, like this:

```swift
List {
    Section(header: Text("Other tasks"), footer: Text("End")) {
        Text("Row 1")
        Text("Row 2")
        Text("Row 3")
    }
}
```

By default your section headers will match the default iOS style, but you can request larger, bolder section text using the `headerProminence()` modifier and specifying `.increased`, like this:

```swift
List {
    Section(header: Text("Header")) {
        Text("Row")
    }
    .headerProminence(.increased)
}
.listStyle(.insetGrouped)
```
