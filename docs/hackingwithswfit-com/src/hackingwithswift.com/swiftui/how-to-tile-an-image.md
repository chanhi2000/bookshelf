> Updated for Xcode 15

If SwiftUI is asked to make an image view take up more space than the image was designed for, its default behavior is to stretch the image so that it fits the space you've asked for. However, it doesn't need to be that way: it can also _tile_ the image, i.e. repeat it horizontally and vertically so the space is fully filled.

The key is to use the `resizable()` modifier with its `resizingMode` parameter. This can be either `.stretch` (the default) or `.tile`, with `.tile` being what you're looking for.

In code it looks like this:

```swift
Image("logo")
    .resizable(resizingMode: .tile)
```

If you only want to tile part of the image - leading one or more edges fixed to the image view's edges - you can provide edge insets to the first parameter, like this:

```swift
Image("logo")
    .resizable(capInsets: EdgeInsets(top: 20, leading: 20, bottom: 20, trailing: 20), resizingMode: .tile)
```
