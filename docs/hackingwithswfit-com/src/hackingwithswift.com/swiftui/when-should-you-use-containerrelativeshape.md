SwiftUI has a number of built-in shapes that are self-explanatory, but there's one that stands out: `ContainerRelativeShape`. This isn't a fixed shape, but is instead designed to be an insettable version of whatever shape it's placed inside, which is particularly important when creating home screen widgets.

::: important

At this time, `ContainerRelativeShape` works only inside widgets. You can use it elsewhere, but it will just make a rectangle.

:::

For example, we could write code that draws a blue shape in our widget, and use `ContainerRelativeShape` to make sure it's the same shape as the widget itself:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            ContainerRelativeShape()
                .inset(by: 4)
                .fill(.blue)

            Text("Hello, World!")
                .font(.title)
        }
        .frame(width: 300, height: 200)
        .background(.red)
        .clipShape(Capsule())
    }
}
```

SwiftUI is smart here: as you inset the container shape further and further, it will scale the corner radius of the container so it looks great in your widget.
