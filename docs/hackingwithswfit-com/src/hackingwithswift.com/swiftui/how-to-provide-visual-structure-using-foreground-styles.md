> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI provides a `foregroundStyle()` modifier to control the way text, images, and shapes are styled all at once. In its simplest form this is similar to using `foregroundStyle()` with `.secondary`, but not only does it unlock more of the semantic colors - `.tertiary` and `.quaternary`, it also adds support for anything that conforms to `ShapeStyle`.

So, here's an example of an image and some text rendered using quaternary style, which is the lowest of four importance levels for content:

```swift
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "clock.fill")
    Text("Set the time")
}
.font(.largeTitle.bold())
.foregroundStyle(.quaternary)
```

A clock symbol beside the words “Set the time”, both in faint grey.

Like I said, anything that conforms to `ShapeStyle` also works, meaning that we can render our `HStack` with a red to black linear gradient using the same modifier:

```swift
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "clock.fill")
    Text("Set the time")
}
.font(.largeTitle.bold())
.foregroundStyle(
    .linearGradient(
        colors: [.red, .black],
        startPoint: .top,
        endPoint: .bottom
    )
)
```
