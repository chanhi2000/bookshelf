> Updated for Xcode 16

**Improved in iOS 18**

SwiftUI's `@Entry` macro makes it straightforward to create custom values for the environment, although I'd recommend you also add a `View` extension to make your code clearer.

The first step is to make an extension on `EnvironmentValues`, using `@Entry` inside there to create your custom environment key, give it a type, and also give it a default value:

```swift
extension EnvironmentValues {
    @Entry var iconColor: Color = .red
}
```

The `@Entry` macro automatically turns that into a fully fledged environment key and value, meaning that we can now use `environment(\.iconColor, .blue)` to set a value, and `@Environment(\.iconColor)` to read that value back out, like this:

```swift
struct BubblesView: View {
    @Environment(\.iconColor) var iconColor

    var body: some View {
        Image(systemName: "bubbles.and.sparkles.fill")
            .foregroundStyle(iconColor)
            .font(.largeTitle)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            BubblesView()
                .environment(\.iconColor, .blue)

            BubblesView()
                .environment(\.iconColor, .red)
        }
    }
}
```
