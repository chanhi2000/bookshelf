> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI's `sensoryFeedback()` modifier provides built-in support for a range of simple haptics, which means we can create vibration effects for success, failure, selection, impacts, and more.

To trigger feedback, attach the `sensoryFeedback()` to any view, telling it what kind of effect to make and what the trigger should be - when the effect should be played. SwiftUI will monitor the trigger value, and run your haptic effect whenever it changes.

For example, if you had a button that marks a task as being complete, you could play a haptic when completion happens:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var taskIsComplete = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Mark Complete") {
            taskIsComplete = true
        }
        .sensoryFeedback(.success, trigger: taskIsComplete)
    }
}
```

For more fine-grained control, you can decide exactly which type of haptic effect to trigger based on comparing the old and new value of your trigger. For example, this uses the `.impact` haptic effect with varying intensities based on the difference between two random numbers:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var randomNumber = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Mark Complete") {
            randomNumber = Double.random(in: 0...1)
        }
        .sensoryFeedback(trigger: randomNumber) { oldValue, newValue in
            let amount = abs(oldValue - newValue)
            return .impact(flexibility: .solid, intensity: amount)
        }
    }
}
```

And finally, you can provide a fixed haptic effect and customize when it's triggered by providing your own comparison function. As an example, this will trigger the `.success` haptic when the difference between two random numbers is more than 0.5:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var randomNumber = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Mark Complete") {
            randomNumber = Double.random(in: 0...1)
        }
        .sensoryFeedback(.success, trigger: randomNumber) { oldValue, newValue in
            abs(oldValue - newValue) > 0.5
        }
    }
}
```
