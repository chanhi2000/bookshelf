If you have a `NavigationLink` or `Picker` that isn’t working, this usually happens because in some situations SwiftUI expects the containing view to be inside a `NavigationStack`. So, you might see a list row showing a disclosure indicator, but for it to appear disabled.

To fix the problem, wrap your view in a `NavigationStack`, like this:

```swift
NavigationStack {
    NavigationLink {
        Text("Detail view")
    } label: {
        Text("Show detail view")
    }
}
```
