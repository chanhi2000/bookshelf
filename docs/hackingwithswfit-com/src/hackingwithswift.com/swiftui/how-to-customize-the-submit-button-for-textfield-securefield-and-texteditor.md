> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

By default, `TextField` and `SecureField` show a simple “Return” button on the keyboard, but the `submitLabel()` modifier let us choose from a range of alternatives.

For example, if you wanted to show the localized form of “Join” for the button, you would use this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username = ""

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Username", text: $username)
            .submitLabel(.join)
    }
}
```

![A keyboard with a blue “join” button in the bottom right.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-customize-the-submit-button-for-textfield-securefield-and-texteditor-1~dark.png)

There are lots of different button options you choose from by passing different values to `submitLabel()`:

- `continue`
- `done`
- `go`
- `join`
- `next`
- `return`
- `route`
- `search`
- `send`

All those work equally well with `TextField`, `SecureField`, and `TextView`.
