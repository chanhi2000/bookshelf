> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `TextField` supports placeholder text just like `UITextField` did - gray text that is shown in the text field when it's empty, either giving users a prompt (“Enter your password”) or showing some example data.

To set your placeholder text, pass it in as part of the initializer for your text field, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var emailAddress = ""

    var body: some View {
        TextField("johnnyappleseed@apple.com", text: $emailAddress)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
            .padding()
    }
}
```

> [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-zipper"/>Download this as an Xcode project](https://hackingwithswift.com/files/projects/swiftui/how-to-add-a-placeholder-to-a-textfield-1.zip)

![A text field with a thin grey outline containing the placeholder text “johnnyappleseed@apple.com”.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-add-a-placeholder-to-a-textfield-1~dark.png)

::: important

If you're using Xcode 12 you need to use `RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle()` rather than `.roundedBorder`.

:::

That will show “johnnyappleseed@apple.com” in the text field while it's empty, but as soon as the user types something in there it disappears.
