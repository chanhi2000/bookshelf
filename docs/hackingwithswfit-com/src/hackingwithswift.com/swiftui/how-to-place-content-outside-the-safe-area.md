> Updated for Xcode 15

By default your SwiftUI views will mostly stay inside the safe area - they will go to the bottom of the screen, but it won't go near any notch at the top of the device.

If you want to change that - if you want your view to be truly full screen, even if that means being partly obscured by a notch or other hardware cut outs - then you should use the `ignoresSafeArea()` modifier.

For example, this creates a red text view that asks to fill all available space, then sets it to ignore any safe areas so that it goes truly edge to edge.

```swift
Text("Hello World")
    .frame(minWidth: 100, maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 100, maxHeight: .infinity)
    .background(.red)
    .ignoresSafeArea()
```

There is a second, similar modifier called `safeAreaInset()`, which allows us to place distinct content outside the safe area while also adjusting the remaining safe area so that all its contents remain visible.
