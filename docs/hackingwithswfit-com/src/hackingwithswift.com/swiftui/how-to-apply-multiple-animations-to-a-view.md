> Updated for Xcode 15

**Improved in iOS 17**

The order in which we use SwiftUI’s `animation()` modifier affects which modifiers get animated, and it’s also possible to add multiple `animation()` modifiers in order to get *different* animations.

**There are two ways of doing this:** A newer, clearer approach that’s available from iOS 17 and later, and an older alternative that also works in iOS 16 and earlier.

First, the new approach. In this code we animate the background color over one second, and the clip shape over two seconds:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isEnabled = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Press Me") {
            isEnabled.toggle()
        }
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 1)) { content in
            content
                .background(isEnabled ? .green : .red)
        }
        .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 2)) { content in
            content
                .clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius: isEnabled ? 100 : 0))
        }
    }
}
```

You don’t need to specify a value to watch when using this new code, because you’re only ever animating the things specified in your close.

When using the older approach, you add multiple `animation()` modifiers wherever you want to adjust the animation stack for previous modifiers. For example, we could write code to create a button that animates between enabled and disabled states, making the corner rounding and background color changes. If we wanted the corner rounding to animate but not the color change, we’d use an animation such as `animation(.default)` after the clip shape, then `animation(nil)` after the background, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isEnabled = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Press Me") {
            isEnabled.toggle()
        }
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .background(isEnabled ? .green : .red)
        .animation(nil, value: isEnabled)
        .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: isEnabled ? 100 : 0))
        .animation(.default, value: isEnabled)
    }
}
```

Using these techniques it’s possible to animate every modifier differently if you need to.
