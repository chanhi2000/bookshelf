> Updated for Xcode 15

If you followed my [Core Data and SwiftUI set up instructions](/hackingwithswift.com/swiftui/how-to-configure-core-data-to-work-with-swiftui.md), you’ve already injected your managed object context into the SwiftUI environment.

If not, make sure you add this code to your scene delegate:

```swift
ContentView()
    .environment(\.managedObjectContext, yourCoreDataContext)
```

That passes our view context directly into `ContentView` as environment data, which means we can add an `@Environment` property to `ContentView` to read the managed object context right out:

```swift
@Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var managedObjectContext
```

::: note

Adding a local property for the managed object context isn’t required for performing fetch requests using `@FetchRequest` - you only need it for saving, deleting, and some other tasks.
