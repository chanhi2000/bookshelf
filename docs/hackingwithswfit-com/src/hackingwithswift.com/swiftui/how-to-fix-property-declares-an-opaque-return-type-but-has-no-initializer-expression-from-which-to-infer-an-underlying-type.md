This usually happens because you accidentally created a view without filling in its contents, like this:

```swift
struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {

    }
}
```

If you created that view as a placeholder, just give it so temporary content to make the compiler happy, like this:

```swift
struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Placeholder")
    }
}
```
