**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI’s `withAnimation()` function can optionally be given a completion callback with code to run when the animation finishes. This might be where you adjust some program state, but you can also use it as a simple way to chain animations together - to animate one thing, then animate something else afterwards.

For example, this makes a button scale up then fade out:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scaleUp = false
    @State private var fadeOut = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Me!") {
            withAnimation {
                scaleUp = true
            } completion: {
                withAnimation {
                    fadeOut = true
                }
            }
        }
        .scaleEffect(scaleUp ? 3 : 1)
        .opacity(fadeOut ? 0 : 1)
    }
}
```

There is one little subtlety here that might hit you: if you’re using a spring animation it’s possible there’s a very long tail of movement at the end, where your animation is moving small fractions of a point that are imperceptible to the user.

The default behavior of `withAnimation()` is to consider the animation complete even with that long tail of tiny movement still happening, but if you wanted it to be 100% finished you can override the default like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scaleUp = false
    @State private var fadeOut = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Me!") {
            withAnimation(.bouncy, completionCriteria: .removed) {
                scaleUp = true
            } completion: {
                withAnimation {
                    fadeOut = true
                }
            }
        }
        .scaleEffect(scaleUp ? 3 : 1)
        .opacity(fadeOut ? 0 : 1)
    }
}
```

I probably wouldn’t recommend that unless you had a very specific use case - the default setting ought to be fine.

::: tip

For more complex effects, consider using a phase animator instead of animation completion closures.
