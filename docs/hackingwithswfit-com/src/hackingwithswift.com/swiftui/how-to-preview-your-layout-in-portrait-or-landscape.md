> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI has a dedicated `previewInterfaceOrientation()` modifier that controls the way device previews look in Xcode’s canvas. To use it, pass one of the four device rotation options: `.portrait`, `.portraitUpsideDown`, `.landscapeLeft`, or `.landscapeRight`.

For example, this will show a landscape left preview:

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
            .previewInterfaceOrientation(.landscapeLeft)
    }
}
```

Remember, your preview provider can contain several devices and they’ll display one above the other. This means you can have both portrait and landscape visible at the same time:

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()

        ContentView()
            .previewInterfaceOrientation(.landscapeLeft)
    }
}
```
