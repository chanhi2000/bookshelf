> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI gives us the `mask()` modifier for masking one with another, which means you can mask an image using text or an image using an image, or more.

For example, this creates a 300x300 image of stripes, then masks it using the text “SWIFT!” so that the letters act as a cut out for the image:

```swift
Image("laser-show")
    .resizable()
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
    .mask(
        Text("SWIFT!")
            .font(.system(size: 72))
    )
```

![The text “SWIFT!” forms a mask through which we can see a laser show.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-mask-one-view-with-another-1~dark@2x.png)

The `mask()` modifier is different from `clipShape()`, because it also applies any transparency from the masking view - you get to have holes in your underlying view based on the transparency of your mask. On the other hand, `clipShape()` only adjusts the outside shape of the view you apply it to.
