If you import StoreKit into your SwiftUI app, you’ll gain access to an environment key called `requestReview`, which allows you to prompt the user to leave a review for your app.

To use it, first important StoreKit into your project, add the environment key as property in your view, then call it at an appropriate time. Here’s some code to get you started:

```swift
import StoreKit
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.requestReview) var requestReview

    var body: some View {
        Button("Review the app") {
            requestReview()
        }
    }
}
```

::: important

Apple hasn’t documented this because, well, *Apple*, but I would imagine this works the same as the older UIKit equivalent where this is a *request* to show the review dialog - there’s a good chance it will do nothing, because the system doesn’t want to spam the user with messages.

:::

So, even though I’ve just shown you a code example using a button, please be much smarter in your own projects: wait until the user has used your app successfully quite a few times so they are happy, then call `requestReview()` in a way that is *not* in response to a button press - remember, it might do nothing at all.
