> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `TextField` enables autocorrect by default, which is what you'll want in most cases. However, if you want to disable it you can do so by using the `disableAutocorrection()` modifier, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = ""

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter your name", text: $name)
            .disableAutocorrection(true)
    }
}
```

::: tip

In earlier Xcode releases, the icon for disabling autocorrect is a duck with a line through it. I'll let you figure out why for yourself…
