> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI provides `MagnifyGesture` for tracking pinch to zoom for views, which can be bound to a `scaleEffect()` modifier so the user’s pinch gesture automatically scales up or shrinks a view.

If you want to keep their zoom level once they finish the gesture, you should track their current and total zoom level together, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var currentZoom = 0.0
    @State private var totalZoom = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Image("singapore")
            .scaleEffect(currentZoom + totalZoom)
            .gesture(
                MagnifyGesture()
                    .onChanged { value in
                        currentZoom = value.magnification - 1
                    }
                    .onEnded { value in
                        totalZoom += currentZoom
                        currentZoom = 0
                    }
            )
            .accessibilityZoomAction { action in
                if action.direction == .zoomIn {
                    totalZoom += 1
                } else {
                    totalZoom -= 1
                }
            }
    }
}
```

::: tip

Subtract 1 from `value.magnification` is important, because 1 is its default value for a new gesture. Using the `accessibilityZoomAction()` modifier allows assistive technologies to control the zoom level.

:::

On the other hand, if you want to track their gesture but reset back to 0 each time, use `@GestureState` like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @GestureState private var zoom = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Image("singapore")
            .scaleEffect(zoom)
            .gesture(
                MagnifyGesture()
                    .updating($zoom) { value, gestureState, transaction in
                        gestureState = value.magnification
                    }
            )
    }
}
```
