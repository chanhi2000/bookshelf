There are three common reasons this error occurs, and all are relatively easy to fix.

The first reason is using a `List` or `ForEach` like this:

```swift
ForEach(1...10) {
```

SwiftUI supports the half-open range operator, `..<`, but not the closed range operator. As a result, you need to rewrite the above code to this:

```swift
ForEach(0..<10) {
```

The second reason is using a `List` or `ForEach` on primitive types that don’t conform to the `Identifiable` protocol, such as an array of strings or integers. In this situation, you should use `id: \.self` as the second parameter to your `List` or `ForEach`, like this:

```swift
ForEach(stringArray, id: \.self) {
```

That tells SwiftUI that each value in the array is unique, and so can be used to identify each item in the loop.

The final reason its happens is if you’re looping over an array of custom structs that don’t conform to `Identifiable`. Here you should add either add a conformance to that protocol (which means adding an `id` property that is unique), or use `id: \.someUniquePropertyName` as the second parameter to your `List` or `ForEach`, which uses that property instead of the ID.

For example:

```swift
struct User: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let username: String
}
```

If you were looping over an array of those `User` objects and wanted to identify them uniquely by their username, you’d use this:

```swift
ForEach(users, id: \.username) {
```
