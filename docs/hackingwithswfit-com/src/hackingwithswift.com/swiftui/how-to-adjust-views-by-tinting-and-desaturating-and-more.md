SwiftUI lets us finely control the way views look by adjusting their brightness, tint, hue, saturation, and more, all by using various modifiers.

For example, this creates an image view and tints the whole thing red:

```swift
Image("cat")
    .colorMultiply(.red)
```

You can adjust the saturation of views to any amount, where 0.0 is fully gray and 1.0 is its original color:

```swift
Image("boats")
    .saturation(0.3)
```

You can even dynamically adjust the contrast of a view by using the `contrast()` modifier. A value of 0.0 yields no contrast (a flat gray image), 1.0 gives you the original image, and everything above 1.0 *adds* contrast.

So, this will reduce the image contrast to 50%:

```swift
Image("sunset")
    .contrast(0.5)
```
