> Updated for Xcode 16

**Improved in iOS 18**

SwiftUI's previews can be used with `@State` bindings by using the `@Previewable` macro, which lets us use testing state alongside views such as `TextField` and `Toggle`.

For example, this creates a local piece of state and binds it to a textfield:

```swift
#Preview {
    @Previewable @State var username = "Anonymous"
    TextField("Enter your name", text: $username)
}
```

::: important

`@Previewable` must only be used inside `#Preview`.

:::

The `@Previewable` macro can be used alongside any SwiftUI property wrapper, including `@FocusState` and `@GestureState`.
