SwiftUI's `TextField` has a single line by default, and `TextEditor` is a multiline alternative based on how much space you want to allocate. But there's a middle ground: if we pass an `axis` parameter to `TextField`, we can ask it to *start* as a single line and grow upwards as the user types, optionally switching to scrolling once the text goes past a certain length.

For example, this creates a `TextField` that automatically expands as the user enters more and more text:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var bio = "About me"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Describe yourself", text: $bio, axis: .vertical)
                .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)

            Text(bio)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

You can control how big the `TextField` can grow by adding a `lineLimit()` modifier. For example, we might want to say that it should start out as a single line, but allow growth up to a maximum of five lines:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var bio = "About me"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Describe yourself", text: $bio, axis: .vertical)
                .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
                .lineLimit(5)

            Text(bio)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

That doesn't mean the user can't type *more* than five lines, only that once the `TextField` goes beyond that limit it will switch to scrolling rather than growing further.

You can pass a range here if you want, for example using `lineLimit(2...5)` to mean “always be at least two lines high, but grow up to five.”

You can also use the `reservesSpace` parameter to `lineLimit()` so that the view automatically allocates enough space for the maximum size it can have. For example, this creates a `TextField` that reserves enough layout space to hold up to five lines of text:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var bio = "About me"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Describe yourself", text: $bio, axis: .vertical)
                .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
                .lineLimit(5, reservesSpace: true)

            Text(bio)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

The combination of this growing behavior and its ability to have a placeholder makes `TextField` a really great choice for entering user text, and preferable to `TextEditor` in situations where you aren't relying on an exact view frame and you don't need search and replace functionality.
