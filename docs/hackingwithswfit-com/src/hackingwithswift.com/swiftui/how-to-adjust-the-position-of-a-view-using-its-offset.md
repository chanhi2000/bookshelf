All views have a natural position inside your hierarchy, but the `offset()` modifier lets you move them relative to that natural position. This is particularly useful inside `ZStack`, where it lets you control how views should overlap.

::: important

Using `offset()` will cause a view to be moved relative to its natural position, but *won’t* affect the position of other views or any other modifiers placed after the offset. This means you need to think carefully how you use it, not least to make sure views don’t overlap if that wasn’t your intention.

:::

For example, in this `VStack` we can use `offset()` to move the second item down by 15 points so that it begins to overlap the third item:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Home")
    Text("Options")
        .offset(y: 15)
    Text("Help")
}
```

You will commonly find that using `padding()` together with `offset()` gives you the result you’re looking for, as that moves one view around while also adjusting the views next to it to match.

For example, this will move the second item down by 15 points, but add 15 points of padding to its bottom edge so that it doesn’t overlap the text view below:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Home")
    Text("Options")
        .offset(y: 15)
        .padding(.bottom, 15)
    Text("Help")
}
```

As I said earlier, any modifiers placed after `offset()` won’t be affected by the change in position, which might cause unexpected results. In this following example, I’ve used `background()` both before and after the offset, so you can see how they are different:

```swift
HStack {
    Text("Before")
        .background(.red)
        .offset(y: 15)

    Text("After")
        .offset(y: 15)
        .background(.red)
}
```

When used in conjunction with a `ZStack`, offsets let us position one view inside another, which is particularly useful when you control the alignment of the `ZStack`.

For example, if we have a `ZStack` showing a photo along with the name of the photographer, we might use `.bottomTrailing` alignment to make the image take up all the available space while having the credit line sit in the bottom-right corner, then use `offset(x: -5, y: -5)` to pull the credit line back by five points:

```swift
ZStack(alignment: .bottomTrailing) {
    Image("scotland")
    Text("Photo credit: Paul Hudson.")
        .padding(4)
        .background(.black)
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
        .offset(x: -5, y: -5)
}
```

Placing the offset at the end of the other modifiers ensures they all move together.
