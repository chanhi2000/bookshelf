> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI supports size classes natively by exposing them in the environment for us to read. To use them, first create an `@Environment` object that will store its value, then check the value of that property whenever you need, looking for either the `.compact` or `.regular` size class.

For example:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var horizontalSizeClass

    var body: some View {
        if horizontalSizeClass == .compact {
            Text("Compact")
        } else {
            Text("Regular")
        }
    }
}
```

Size classes are a great way to make your user interfaces intelligently adapt to the available space by using a `VStack` or a `HStack` for your content. For example, if you have lots of space you might lay things out horizontally, but switch to vertical layout when space is limited.
