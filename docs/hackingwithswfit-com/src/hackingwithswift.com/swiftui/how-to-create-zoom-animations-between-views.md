SwiftUI provides a zoom transition effect that can be used when pushing to a new view with a `NavigationStack`, and also used when pushing to a sheet or a full-screen cover presentation. It's works similarly to a matched geometry effect, except it works across presentations where matched geometry effect fails.

Using it takes three steps:

1. Declare a new animation namespace using `@Namespace`
2. Use the `matchedTransitionSource()` modifier on whatever source view is triggering the transition.
3. Use the `navigationTransition()` modifier on whatever destination view you're navigating to.

Both modifiers must be given a stable view ID that is being transitioned, just like matched geometry effects.

Let's start with a simple example, animating to a sheet where all the code is inside a single view.

First, we'd define some data to work with:

```swift
struct Icon: Identifiable {
    var id: String
    var color: Color
}
```

And now we can define a view that shows lots of icons, zooming one up when tapped:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let icons = [
        Icon(id: "figure.badminton", color: .red),
        Icon(id: "figure.fencing", color: .orange),
        Icon(id: "figure.gymnastics", color: .green),
        Icon(id: "figure.indoor.cycle", color: .blue),
        Icon(id: "figure.outdoor.cycle", color: .purple),
        Icon(id: "figure.rower", color: .indigo),
    ]

    @Namespace var animation
    @State private var selected: Icon?

    var body: some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: [.init(.adaptive(minimum: 100, maximum: 300))]) {
            ForEach(icons) { icon in
                Button {
                    selected = icon
                } label: {
                    Image(systemName: icon.id)
                }
                .foregroundStyle(icon.color.gradient)
                .font(.system(size: 100))
                .matchedTransitionSource(id: icon.id, in: animation)
            }
        }
        .sheet(item: $selected) { icon in
            Image(systemName: icon.id)
                .font(.system(size: 300))
                .foregroundStyle(icon.color.gradient)
                .navigationTransition(.zoom(sourceID: icon.id, in: animation))
        }
    }
}
```

That works, but in practice you're going to want to split the source and destination views more cleanly, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let icons = [
        Icon(id: "figure.badminton", color: .red),
        Icon(id: "figure.fencing", color: .orange),
        Icon(id: "figure.gymnastics", color: .green),
        Icon(id: "figure.indoor.cycle", color: .blue),
        Icon(id: "figure.outdoor.cycle", color: .purple),
        Icon(id: "figure.rower", color: .indigo),
    ]

    @Namespace var animation
    @State private var selected: Icon?

    var body: some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: [.init(.adaptive(minimum: 100, maximum: 300))]) {
            ForEach(icons) { icon in
                Button {
                    selected = icon
                } label: {
                    Image(systemName: icon.id)
                }
                .foregroundStyle(icon.color.gradient)
                .font(.system(size: 100))
                .matchedTransitionSource(id: icon.id, in: animation)
            }
        }
        .sheet(item: $selected) { icon in
            DestinationView(icon: icon, animation: animation)
        }
    }
}

struct DestinationView: View {
    var icon: Icon
    var animation: Namespace.ID

    var body: some View {
        Image(systemName: icon.id)
            .font(.system(size: 300))
            .foregroundStyle(icon.color.gradient)
            .navigationTransition(.zoom(sourceID: icon.id, in: animation))
    }
}
```
