Okay, let's fix up that order total so that it's accurate. We're going to add a `totalPrice` computed property to our type, which will calculate the value of their tip, add it to the total for their order, and return that amount.

Please add this to `CheckoutView` now:

```swift
var totalPrice: String {
    let total = Double(order.total)
    let tipValue = total / 100 * Double(tipAmount)
    return (total + tipValue).formatted(.currency(code: "USD"))
}
```

Now, remember that SwiftUI will re-invoke our `body` property whenever any of our `@State` properties change. As a result, we can use that computed property right inside our layout, and it will automatically change as the segmented control changes:

```swift
Section("Total: \(totalPrice)") {
```

If you try that out you should see it all works great - the total price reflects the items we're ordering, plus any tip the user selected.
