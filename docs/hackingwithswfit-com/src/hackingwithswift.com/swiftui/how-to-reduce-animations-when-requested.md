SwiftUI’s `withAnimation()` function makes it easy to perform custom animations on our views, but it doesn’t respect the “Reduce Motion” accessibility setting and so might make your apps hard to use for many people.

If you want to use `withAnimation()` while also honoring that setting, I recommend you add a global function like this one:

```swift
func withOptionalAnimation<Result>(_ animation: Animation? = .default, _ body: () throws -> Result) rethrows -> Result {
    if UIAccessibility.isReduceMotionEnabled {
        return try body()
    } else {
        return try withAnimation(animation, body)
    }
}
```

That automatically checks whether Reduce Motion is enabled every time the animation is triggered, and disables it for users who have specifically requested less animation. 

In case you were wondering, `withAnimation()` is also a global function - a function that sits outside of any other type - so this new withOptionalAnimation()` function will behave the same.

So, you can use it wherever you would use `withAnimation()`, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scale = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, World!")
            .scaleEffect(scale)
            .onTapGesture {
                withOptionalAnimation {
                    scale *= 1.5
                }
            }
    }
}
```
