This rather confusing error message usually happens because you created a container but forgot to include some content inside it - you were probably just experimenting, and wrote code like this:

```swift
VStack {

}
```

If you just want a placeholder while you’re working on something else, use an `EmptyView` to keep the compiler happy, like this:

```swift
VStack {
    EmptyView()
}
```
