> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI's `SecureField` works almost identically to a regular `TextField` except the characters are masked out for privacy. Just like `TextField`, you get to provide a placeholder giving the user a suggestion for what to enter, and the underlying value you bind to is still a plain string so you can check it as needed.

Here's an example that creates a `SecureField` bound to a local `@State` property so we can show what they typed:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var password: String = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            SecureField("Enter a password", text: $password)
            Text("You entered: \(password)")
        }
    }
}
```
