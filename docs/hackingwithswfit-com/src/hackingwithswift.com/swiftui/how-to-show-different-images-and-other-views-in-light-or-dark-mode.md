SwiftUI can load light and dark mode images directly from your asset catalog depending on the user's current appearance setting, but if you *aren't* using an asset catalog - for example if you downloaded the images or generated them locally - you need to do a little extra work.

The simplest solution is to create a new view that handles both light and dark mode images, like this:

```swift
struct AdaptiveImage: View {
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme
    let light: Image
    let dark: Image

    @ViewBuilder var body: some View {
        if colorScheme == .light {
            light
        } else {
            dark
        }
    }
}
```

That allows you to pass both images in, and SwiftUI will automatically select the correct one for both light and dark mode:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        AdaptiveImage(light: Image(systemName: "sun.max"), dark: Image(systemName: "moon"))
    }
}
```

That works great if you just want to flip between light and dark mode images, but if we add a little extra code we can create a wrapper view able to display completely different content depending on light and dark mode:

```swift
struct AdaptiveView<T: View, U: View>: View {
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme
    let light: T
    let dark: U

    init(light: T, dark: U) {
        self.light = light
        self.dark = dark
    }

    init(light: () -> T, dark: () -> U) {
        self.light = light()
        self.dark = dark()
    }

    @ViewBuilder var body: some View {
        if colorScheme == .light {
            light
        } else {
            dark
        }
    }
}
```

That retains the same simple initializer, but now adds alternatives that accept closures. So, with that more advanced version we can now flip between more complicated layouts:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            AdaptiveView {
                VStack {
                    Text("Light mode")
                    Image(systemName: "sun.max")
                }
            } dark: {
                HStack {
                    Text("Dark mode")
                    Image(systemName: "moon")
                }
            }
            .font(.largeTitle)
        }
    }
}
```
