> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 16**

SwiftUI has a dedicated `PasteButton` view that lets us receive any kind of data that conforms to the `Transferable` protocol, such as `String` and `Data`.

For example, we could let the user type into a text field, or add a `PasteButton` to update the text directly:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username = "@twostraws"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
                .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)

            PasteButton(payloadType: String.self) { strings in
                guard let first = strings.first else { return }
                username = first
            }
            .buttonBorderShape(.capsule)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

Notice how we specify `String.self` as the payload type, but the input into the closure is an array of strings.

Given that `TextField` has its own cut, copy, and paste menu options, I think `PasteButton` will be much more useful in places where you aren't handling text, e.g. when the user wants to paste a picture into your app.
