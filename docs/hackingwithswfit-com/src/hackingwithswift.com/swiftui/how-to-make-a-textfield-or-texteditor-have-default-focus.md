> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI on macOS provides a `defaultFocus()` modifier that lets us activate one view as the first responder to user input as soon as a view is shown. Sadly it doesn't exist on iOS, but we can work around that using `onAppear()`.

First, here's the code with the workaround in place, suitable for use on iOS:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    enum FocusedField {
        case firstName, lastName
    }

    @State private var firstName = ""
    @State private var lastName = ""
    @FocusState private var focusedField: FocusedField?

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("First name", text: $firstName)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .firstName)

            TextField("Last name", text: $lastName)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .lastName)
        }
        .onAppear {
            focusedField = .firstName
        }
    }
}
```

And here's the code using `defaultFocus()`, suitable for use on macOS:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    enum FocusedField {
        case firstName, lastName
    }

    @State private var firstName = ""
    @State private var lastName = ""
    @FocusState private var focusedField: FocusedField?

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("First name", text: $firstName)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .firstName)

            TextField("Last name", text: $lastName)
                .focused($focusedField, equals: .lastName)
        }
        .defaultFocus($focusedField, .firstName)
    }
}
```

Hopefully `defaultFocus()` comes to iOS in a future update!
