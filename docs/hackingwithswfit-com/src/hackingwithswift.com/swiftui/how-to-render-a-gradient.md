> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated in iOS 16**

SwiftUI gives us a variety of gradient options, all of which can be used in a variety of ways.

If you're targeting iOS 16 or later, you can get a beautifully simple linear gradient by appending `.gradient` to whatever color you're using:

```swift
Rectangle().fill(.blue.gradient)
```

For more advanced gradients, or to support iOS versions prior to 16, you can use one of SwiftUI's built in gradient types to get exact control. For example, you could render a text view using a white to black linear gradient like this:

```swift
Text("Hello World")
    .padding()
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .background(
        LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.white, .black]), startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottom)
    )
```

The colors are specified as an array and you can have as many as you want - by default SwiftUI will space them equally. So, we could go from white to red to black like this:

```swift
Text("Hello World")
    .padding()
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .background(
        LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.white, .red, .black]), startPoint: .top, endPoint: .bottom)
    )
```

To make a horizontal gradient rather than a vertical one, use `.leading` and `.trailing` for your start and end points:

```swift
Text("Hello World")
    .padding()
    .foregroundStyle(.white)
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .background(
        LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.white, .red, .black]), startPoint: .leading, endPoint: .trailing)
    )
```

For alternative gradient styles, try `RadialGradient` or `AngularGradient`. As an example, this creates a radial gradient through a variety of colors, starting from the center of the circle and going out to the edges:

```swift
Circle()
    .fill(
        RadialGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.red, .yellow, .green, .blue, .purple]), center: .center, startRadius: 50, endRadius: 100)
    )
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
```

And this creates an angular gradient (often called a conic gradient), cycling through various colors then returning to the beginning:

```swift
Circle()
    .fill(
        AngularGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.red, .yellow, .green, .blue, .purple, .red]), center: .center)
    )
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
```

Because all three gradient types conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol, you can use them for backgrounds, fills, and strokes. For example, this uses our rainbow conical gradient as a thick inner stroke for a circle:

```swift
Circle()
    .strokeBorder(
        AngularGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.red, .yellow, .green, .blue, .purple, .red]), center: .center, startAngle: .zero, endAngle: .degrees(360)),
        lineWidth: 50
    )
    .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
```
