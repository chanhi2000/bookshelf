> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated in iOS 15**

SwiftUI’s sheets are used to present new views over existing ones, while still allowing users to drag down to dismiss the new view when they are ready.

To use a sheet, give it something to show (some text, an image, a custom view, etc), add a Boolean that defines whether the detail view should be showing, then attach it to your main view as a modal sheet.

For example, this creates a simple detail view, then presents it from `ContentView` when a button is tapped:

```swift
struct SheetView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        Button("Press to dismiss") {
            dismiss()
        }
        .font(.title)
        .padding()
        .background(.black)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingSheet = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Sheet") {
            showingSheet.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingSheet) {
            SheetView()
        }
    }
}
```

::: important

If you’re targeting iOS 14 or below, you should use `@Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode` and `presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()` instead.

:::

Unlike navigation links, sheets don’t require a navigation stack to work.

::: tip

If you don’t want your sheet to be dismissible by dragging downwards on iOS, use the `fullScreenCover()` modifier instead.
