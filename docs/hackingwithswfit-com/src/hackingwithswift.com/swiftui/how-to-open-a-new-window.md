> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI provides an `openWindow` environment key that allows us to create new windows on macOS whenever we need them.

To get started, first edit your `App` scene to include a new `Window`. This means providing a window title, but also an *identifier* - a name we’ll use when asking the system to open this window:

```swift
Window("What's New", id: "whats-new") {
    Text("New in this version…")
}
```

That can be the only scene in your app body, or it can live alongside other windows or window groups. If it *is* the only window in your app, macOS will automatically remove the File > New menu item, and your app will automatically terminate when the last window is closed.

::: tip

If you add an explicit `navigationTitle()` to your window contents, that will override any window title string.

:::

When you want to *open* that window, call the `openWindow` environment key with the same ID value, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.openWindow) var openWindow

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show What's New") {
            openWindow(id: "whats-new")
        }
    }
}
```

The window can also be opened by going to the Window menu - macOS will automatically show it there, using the window title you provided.
