::: tip

You might think this chapter is totally skippable, but unless you're a Swift genius chances are you should read to the end just to be sure.

:::

The basic App template gives you the following:

1. .<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`YourProjectName.swift`. This performs an initial set up, then creates and displays your initial view.
2. .<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift`. This is our initial piece of user interface. If this were a UIKit project, this would be the ViewController class that Xcode gave us.
3. .<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`Assets.xcassets`. This is an asset catalog, which stores all the images and colors used in our project.
4. A group called Preview Content, which contains another asset catalog called Preview Assets.
And that's it - it's a pleasingly small amount of code and resources, which means we can build on it.

The part we really care about - in fact, here it's the only part that matters - is <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift`. This is the main piece of functionality for our app, and it's where we can start trying out various SwiftUI code in just a moment.

First, though: what makes <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift` get shown on the screen?

Well, if you remember I said that <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`YourProjectName.swift` is responsible for managing the way your app is shown. Obviously it's not actually called that - it will be named according to the project name you chose when creating your poject.

Go ahead and open this file now, and you'll see code like this in there:

```swift
@main
struct YourProjectName: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

That code creates a new `ContentView` instance (that's the main piece of functionality we'll be looking at soon), and places it inside a window group so it's visible onscreen. It's effectively bootstrapping our app by showing the first instance of `ContentView`, and from there it's over to us - what do you want to do?

Open <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>`ContentView.swift` and let's look at some actual SwiftUI code. You should see code like this:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

That's not a lot of code, but it does pack in a great deal.

First, notice how `ContentView` is a struct. Developers familiar with UIKit will know that this is _huge_ - we get to benefit from all the immutability and simplicity of values types for our user interface! Folks who _aren't_ familiar with UIKit… well, just nod and smile - you never knew the pain we used to have.

Second, `ContentView` conforms to the `View` protocol. Everything you want to show in SwiftUI needs to conform to `View`, and really that means only one thing: you need to have a property called `body` that returns some sort of `View`.

Third, the return type of `body` is `some View`. The `some` keyword was introduced in Swift 5.1 and is part of a feature called [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>opaque return types](https://youtu.be/DvHkeUxiwYY), and in this case what it means is literally “this will return some sort of `View` but SwiftUI doesn't need to know (or care) what.”

::: important 

Returning `some View` means that the `body` property will return something that conforms to the `View` protocol. You can't forget to return anything at all - the Swift compiler will refuse to build your code.

:::

Fourth, inside the `body` property there's a vertical stack of content showing an image and some text.

Fifth, that stack has a `padding()` method call below it. In SwiftUI this actually creates a new view with padding around it, rather than changing the existing stack. As a result, we call these _modifiers_ because they create modified content, as opposed to _methods_. There are also modifiers to make the image scale bigger and change its color.

Finally, below `ContentView` is `#Preview`, which marks special code to display our view an interactive preview of our view inside Xcode. Right now this creates an instance of `ContentView`, but you can customize these if you need to.
