SwiftUI gives us both `@Environment` and `@EnvironmentObject` property wrappers, but they are subtly different: whereas `@EnvironmentObject` allows us to inject arbitrary values into the environment, `@Environment` is specifically there to work with SwiftUI’s own pre-defined keys.

For example, `@Environment` is great for reading out things like a Core Data managed object context, whether the device is in dark mode or light mode, what size class your view is being rendered with, and more - fixed properties that come from the system. In code, it looks like this:

```swift
@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var horizontalSizeClass
@Environment(\.managedObjectContext) var managedObjectContext
```

On the other hand, `@EnvironmentObject` is designed for arbitrary objects to be read from the environment, like this:

```swift
@EnvironmentObject var order: Order
```

That difference might sound small, but it’s important because of the way `@EnvironmentObject` is implemented. When we say that `order` is of type `Order` SwiftUI will look through its environment to find an object of that type and attach it to the `order` property. However, when using `@Environment` the same behavior isn’t possible, because many things might share the same data type.

For example:

```swift
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion
@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceTransparency) var reduceTransparency
@Environment(\.accessibilityEnabled) var accessibilityEnabled
```

All three of those environment keys return a Boolean, so without specifying exactly which key we mean it would be impossible to read them correctly.
