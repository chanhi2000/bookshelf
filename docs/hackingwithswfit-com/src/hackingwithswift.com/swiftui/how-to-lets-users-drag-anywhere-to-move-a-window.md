> Updated for Xcode 16

**New in macOS 15**

SwiftUI on macOS provides a special `‌WindowDragGesture` type that is specifically designed to let users click and drag on a view to move your window. This is particularly helpful for windows that hide their title, which is more common in smaller utilities.

Use it like this:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("You can drag from here")
    Text("Or from here")
}
.gesture(WindowDragGesture())
```

To get the full effect, you should also add `.windowStyle(.plain)` to your `WindowGroup` or similar scene-level control.
