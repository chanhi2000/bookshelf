SwiftUI’s `fullScreenCover()` modifier gives us a presentation style for times when you want to cover as much of the screen as possible, and in code it works almost identically to regular sheets.

Regular sheets can be dismissed by dragging downwards on them, but that isn’t possible with views presented using `fullScreenCover()`. As a result, it’s important you provide a way to dismiss the presented view, probably using the `dismiss` environment key.

::: important

`fullScreenCover()` is not available on macOS.

:::

For example, this defines a simple `FullScreenModalView` struct that can dismiss itself, then presents it from `ContentView` when another button is pressed:


```swift
struct FullScreenModalView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            Color.primary.edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
            Button("Dismiss Modal") {
                dismiss()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isPresented = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Present!") {
            isPresented.toggle()
        }
        .fullScreenCover(isPresented: $isPresented, content: FullScreenModalView.init)
    }
}
```
