> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 16**

Some SF Symbols support variable coloring, which means they can have different parts filled based on a fraction between 0 and 1.

For example, this shows a Wi-Fi icon that is partly filled in:

```swift
Image(systemName: "wifi", variableValue: 0.5)
```

This value can change over time based on whatever state you're using in your code. For example, we could use a slider to change various icons according to a local property:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var value = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            HStack {
                Image(systemName: "aqi.low", variableValue: value)
                Image(systemName: "wifi", variableValue: value)
                Image(systemName: "chart.bar.fill", variableValue: value)
                Image(systemName: "waveform", variableValue: value)
            }

            Slider(value: $value)
        }
        .font(.system(size: 72))
        .foregroundStyle(.blue)
        .padding()
    }
}
```
