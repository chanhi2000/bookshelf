> Available from Swift 5.2

Swift 5.2 introduced a new diagnostic architecture that aims to improves the quality and precision of error messages issued by Xcode when you make a coding error. This is particularly apparent when working with SwiftUI code, where Swift would often produce false positive error messages.

For an example, consider code like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("What is your name?")
            TextField("Name", text: $name)
                .frame(maxWidth: 300)
        }
    }
}
```

That attempts to bind a `TextField` view to an integer `@State` property, which is invalid. In Swift 5.1 this caused an error for the `frame()` modifier saying **'Int' is not convertible to 'CGFloat?’**, but in Swift 5.2 and later this correctly identifies the error is the `$name` binding: **Cannot convert value of type `Binding<Int>` to expected argument type `Binding<String>`**.

You can find out more about the new diagnostic architecture on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-swift"/>Swift.org blog](https://swift.org/blog/new-diagnostic-arch-overview/).
