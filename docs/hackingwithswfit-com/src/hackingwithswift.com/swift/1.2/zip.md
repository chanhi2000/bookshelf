> Available from Swift 1.2

If you have two sequences that you'd like to join together, the `zip()` function will do just that and return an array of tuples. For example:

```swift
let names = ["Sophie", "Charlotte", "John"]
let scores = [90, 92, 95]
let zipped = zip(names, scores)
```

That will output an array of the tuples ("Sophie", 90), ("Charlotte", 92), and ("John", 95).
