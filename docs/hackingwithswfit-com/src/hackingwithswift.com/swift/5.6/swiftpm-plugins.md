> Available from Swift 5.6

Swift 5.6 includes a raft (\[[1 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md)\], \[[2 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0305-swiftpm-binary-target-improvements.md)\], \[[3 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0325-swiftpm-additional-plugin-apis.md))\], \[[4 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0332-swiftpm-command-plugins.md)\]) of improvements to Swift Package Manager, which combine to add the beginnings of plugin support using external build tools.

At this point earlier adopters are [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"/>reporting](https://x.com/tonyarnold/status/1498508218934644737) that the functionality isn’t quite far along enough to support more [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"/>complex use cases](https://x.com/merowing_/status/1498567302702374912), but it does at least seem to support SwiftGen and there are further examples demonstrating possibilities for DocC and swift-format.
