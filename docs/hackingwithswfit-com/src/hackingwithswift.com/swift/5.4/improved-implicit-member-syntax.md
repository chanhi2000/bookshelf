[SE-0287 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0287-implicit-member-chains.md) improves Swift’s ability to use implicit member expressions, so rather than just having support for exactly one single static member you can make chains of them.

Swift has always had the ability to use implicit member syntax for simple expressions, for example if you wanted to color some text in SwiftUI you could use `.red` rather than `Color.red`:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView1: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("You're not my supervisor!")
            .foregroundColor(.red)
    }
}
```

Prior to Swift 5.4 this did not work with more complex expressions. For example, if you wanted your red color to be slightly transparent you would need to write this:

```swift
struct ContentView2: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("You're not my supervisor!")
            .foregroundColor(Color.red.opacity(0.5))
    }
}
```

From Swift 5.4 onwards the compiler is able to understand multiple chained members, meaning that the `Color` type can be inferred:

```swift
struct ContentView3: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("You're not my supervisor!")
            .foregroundColor(.red.opacity(0.5))
    }
}
```
