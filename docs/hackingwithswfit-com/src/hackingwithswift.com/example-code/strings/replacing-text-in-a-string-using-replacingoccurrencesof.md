<!-- 
It's easy to replace text inside a string thanks to the method `replacingOccurrences(of:)`. This is a string method, and you tell it what to look for and what to replace it with, and you're done.

For example:

```swift
let str = "Swift 4.0 is the best version of Swift to learn, so if you're starting fresh you should definitely learn Swift 4.0."
let replaced = str.replacingOccurrences(of: "4.0", with: "5.0")
```

That will make `replaced` equal to "Swift 5.0 is the best version of Swift to learn, so if you're starting fresh you should definitely learn Swift 5.0.”
