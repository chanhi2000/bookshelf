<!-- 
Regular Swift code can treat strings like other kinds of sequence, so you can use its `count` property to read the number of characters it contains:

```swift
let str = "Hello, world"
let count = str.count
```

However, this falls down when you need to work with Objective-C code, for example `NSRegularExpression`, `NSDataDetector`, `UITextChecker`, and more - they use UTF-16 rather than Swift’s extended grapheme clusters, and so if you use `count` with them you’re likely to miss characters.

Instead, the correct solution is to measure your string’s length using `utf16.count`, like this:

```swift
let input = "This is a test with the URL https://www.hackingwithswift.com to be detected."
let detector = try! NSDataDetector(types: NSTextCheckingResult.CheckingType.link.rawValue)
let matches = detector.matches(in: input, options: [], range: NSRange(location: 0, length: input.utf16.count))
```

That guarantees your string’s length is reported fully when interacting with Objective-C code.
