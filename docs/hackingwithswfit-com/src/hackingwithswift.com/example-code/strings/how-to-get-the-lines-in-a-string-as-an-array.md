<!-- 
Swift’s strings have their lines separated by the `\n` character, which is a line break on Unix operating systems. Using that plus the `components(separatedBy:)` method, you can get an array of all the lines in a string like this:

```swift
let lines = str.components(separatedBy: "\n")
```

If you intend to use that regularly, consider making an extension on `String` like this one:

```swift
extension String {
    var lines: [String] {
        return self.components(separatedBy: "\n")
    }
}
```
