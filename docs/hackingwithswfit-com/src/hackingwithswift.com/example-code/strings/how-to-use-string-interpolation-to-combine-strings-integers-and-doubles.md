String interpolation is Swift's way of letting you insert variables and constants into strings. But at the same time, you can also perform simple operations as part of your interpolation, such as changing letter case and basic mathematics. Swift is also smart enough to understand *how* to bring values into strings, meaning that you can use other strings, integers and floating-point numbers just fine.

Here's an example to get you started:

```swift
let name = "Paul"
let age = 35
let longestPi = 3.141592654

let combined = "This person's name is \(name.uppercased()), their age is \(age) so in \(age) years time they'll be \(age + age), and they know π up to \(longestPi)"
```
