There are two main complex data types in Swift - objects and structs - and they do so many things similarly that you'd be forgiven for not being sure exactly where they differ. Well, one of the key areas is down to copying: two variables can point at the same object so that changing one changes them both, whereas if you tried that with structs you'd find that Swift creates a full copy so that changing the copy does not affect the original.

Having lots of objects point at the same data can be useful, but frequently you'll want to modify *copies* so that modifying one object doesn't have an effect on anything else. To make this work you need to do three things:

- Make your class conform to `NSCopying`. This isn't strictly required, but it makes your intent clear.
<li>Implement the method `copy(with:)`, where the actual copying happens.
<li>Call `copy()` on your object.

Here's an example of a `Person` class that conforms fully to the `NSCopying` protocol:

```swift
    class Person: NSObject, NSCopying {
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
    var age: Int

    init(firstName: String, lastName: String, age: Int) {
        self.firstName = firstName
        self.lastName = lastName
        self.age = age
    }

    func copy(with zone: NSZone? = nil) -> Any {
        let copy = Person(firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, age: age)
        return copy
    }
}
```

Note that `copy(with:)` is implemented by creating a new `Person` object using the current person's information.

With that done, you can test out your copying like this:

```swift
let paul = Person(firstName: "Paul", lastName: "Hudson", age: 36)
let sophie = paul.copy() as! Person

sophie.firstName = "Sophie"
sophie.age = 6

print("\(paul.firstName) \(paul.lastName) is \(paul.age)")
print("\(sophie.firstName) \(sophie.lastName) is \(sophie.age)")
```
