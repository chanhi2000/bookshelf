<!--
If you created a view dynamically and want it gone, it's a one-liner in Swift thanks to the `removeFromSuperview()` method. When you call this, the view gets removed immediately and possibly also destroyed - it will only be kept around if you have a reference to it elsewhere. Here's how it's done:

```swift
yourView.removeFromSuperview()
```
