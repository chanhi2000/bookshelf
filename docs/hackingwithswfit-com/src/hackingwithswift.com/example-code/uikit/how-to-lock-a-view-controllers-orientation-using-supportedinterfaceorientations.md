<!--
At the project level you can configure which orientations your whole app should support, but sometimes you want individual view controllers to support a subset of those. For example, you might want most of your app to work in any orientation, but one part to work specifically in portrait.

To configure this, you need to override the `supportedInterfaceOrientations` property in your `UIViewController` subclass, returning whichever orientations you want. Probably the most common use for this is to support all orientations for iPads, but `.allButUpsideDown` on iPhone. 

Here’s some example code doing just that:

```swift
override var supportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationMask {
    if UIDevice.current.userInterfaceIdiom == .phone {
        return .allButUpsideDown
    } else {
        return .all
    }
}
```
