If you need a quick way to get hold of a view inside a complicated view hierarchy, you're looking for `viewWithTag()` - give it the tag to find and a view to search from, and this method will search all subviews, and all sub-subviews, and so on, until it finds a view with the matching tag number. The method returns an optional `UIView` because it might not find a view with that tag, so unwrap it carefully.

Here's an example:

```swift
if let foundView = view.viewWithTag(0xDEADBEEF) {
    foundView.removeFromSuperview()
}
```

Easy to remember tags such as `0xDEADBEEF` are quite common amongst coders.

NB: Extensive use of `viewWithTag()` is a sign of poor code structure. It's good for the occasional shortcut, but really shouldn't be relied on for serious development.

You see, if you use `viewWithTag()` to find some specific nested view then you’re effectively saying “there's a view that I have given a magic number to, and it's definitely a `UIImageView` (for example), so please find it and use it.” This means you're bypassing all the safety of the Swift compiler: that number might change or be removed, or the view in question might change type or be removed - and neither of those would cause problems or get caught.

If you use `viewWithTag()` rarely then it's fine, but if you find yourself doing it a lot then really you should be thinking about an alternative - making a custom subclass for your table view cell, for example.
