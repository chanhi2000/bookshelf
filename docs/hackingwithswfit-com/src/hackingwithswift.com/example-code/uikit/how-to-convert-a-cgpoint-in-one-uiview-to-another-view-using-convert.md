Each view has its own co-ordinate system, meaning that if I tap a button and ask iOS where I tapped, it will tell me where I tapped *relative to the top-left of the button*. This is usually what you want, but if you want to translate a position in one view into a position it's easy enough to do.

As an example, this code creates two views, creates a virtual "tap", then converts it from the first view's co-ordinate space to the second's:

```swift
let view1 = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 128, height: 128))
let view2 = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 200, y: 200, width: 128, height: 128))

let tap = CGPoint(x: 10, y: 10)
let convertedTap = view1.convert(tap, to: view2)
```

That will set `convertedTap` to X -140.0, Y -140.0.
