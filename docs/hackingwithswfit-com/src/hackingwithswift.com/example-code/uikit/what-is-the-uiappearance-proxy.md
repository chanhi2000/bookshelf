<!--
If you need to make broad changes to UIKit components, the UIAppearance proxy is your friend: you can treat it like an instance of any given UIKit type, except the changes you make there apply to all new instances of that type. Note: it applies to *new* instances of that, and won’t change any *existing* instances you have created.

For example, if you want all navigation bars to have a red background color regardless of where they appear in your app, you could put this into the `didFinishLaunching` method of your app delegate:

```swift
UINavigationBar.appearance().barTintColor = .red
```

For more precise changes you can use `appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf:)` and specify a container appearance proxy. For example, you might want to make bar button items one color when they appear in navigation bars and another color when they appear in toolbars:

```swift
UIBarButtonItem.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UINavigationBar.self]).tintColor = .green
UIBarButtonItem.appearance(whenContainedInInstancesOf: [UIToolbar.self]).tintColor = .red
```

While that’s easy to do, I hope you at least choose better colors!
