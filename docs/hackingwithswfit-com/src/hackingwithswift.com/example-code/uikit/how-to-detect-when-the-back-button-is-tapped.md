You probably already know that `viewWillDisappear()` is called when a view controller is about to go away, and that's also called when the user taps the Back button in a navigation controller. Problem is, the same method is called when the user moves forward, i.e. when you push another view controller onto the stack.

The solution is simple: create a Boolean property called `goingForwards` in your view controller, and set it to `true` before pushing any view controller onto the navigation stack, then set it back to `false` when the view controller is shown again. This way, when `viewWillDisappear()` is called you can check `goingForwards`: if it's false, the user tapped Back.
