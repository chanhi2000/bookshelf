Spring animations work by changing from a start state to an end state, with a slight overshoot and bounce at the end. For example, if you want to animate a view moving from X:0 to X:100, it might move to X:120 before bouncing back to X:80, then X:110 and finally X:100, as if the animation were attached to a spring.

Spring animations are built into iOS as of iOS 7.0 and require two values: how "springy" the spring should be, and how fast it should start. The first value is specified with `usingSpringWithDamping`, where higher values make the bouncing finish faster. The second value is specified with `initialSpringVelocity`, where higher values give the spring more initial momentum.

Here's the code to make a view fade out, then fade it the tiniest bit, then fade out again - all done using a spring animation:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 1, delay: 1, usingSpringWithDamping: 0.5, initialSpringVelocity: 5, options: .curveEaseInOut, animations: {
    self.viewToAnimate.alpha = 0
}) { _ in
    self.viewToAnimate.removeFromSuperview()
}
```
