<!-- 
If you want to read through an array in reverse, you should use the `reversed()` method. You can use this as part of the regular fast enumeration technique if you want, which would give you code like this:

```swift
let array = ["Apples", "Peaches", "Plums"]

for item in array.reversed() {
    print("Found \(item)")
}
```

You can also reverse an enumerated array just by appending the method call, like this:

```swift
for (index, item) in array.reversed().enumerated() {
    print("Found \(item) at position \(index)")
}
```

Note that whether you call `reversed()` then `enumerated()` or vice versa matters! In the above code, enumerate will count upwards, but if you use `array.enumerated().reversed()` it will count backwards.
