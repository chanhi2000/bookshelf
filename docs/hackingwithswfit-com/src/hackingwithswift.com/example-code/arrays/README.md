  "title": "How do you create multi-dimensional arrays?",
  "desc": "ating an array that holds strings is as simple as writing <code>[String]</code>, but what about creating an array where each item is an array of strings - an array of arrays? This is called a multi-dimensional array, because if you were to draw its contents on paper it would look like a grid rather than a line....",
