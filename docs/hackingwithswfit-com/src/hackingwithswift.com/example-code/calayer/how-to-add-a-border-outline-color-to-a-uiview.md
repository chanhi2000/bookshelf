<!-- 
All `UIView` subclasses have a built-in way to draw a border around them using their underlying `CALayer`. For example, to draw a 10-point red border around a view, you'd use this:

```swift
yourView.layer.borderWidth = 10
yourView.layer.borderColor = UIColor.red.cgColor
```

Note that you need to use the `cgColor` property of your `UIColor` in order for this to work. Adding a border to a view even works if you also round the corners of your view - it's very flexible!
