{
  "title": "How to add conditions to a breakpoint",
  "desc": "When you place a regular breakpoint on a line of code, Xcode will pause at that point when it’s reached. However, sometimes you need something a little more fine-grained: perhaps you want the breakpoint to be ignored the first few times it’s hit, or perhaps you want execution to be paused only when a certain condition is true.",

  "desc": "Swift Package Manager is a tool that generates Swift projects then manages dependencies for them, and it’s commonly used if want to build your projects without Xcode. If you have Xcode installed then you already have the Swift Package Manager, but if you’re using Linux it will come with the Swift for Linux package from https://swift.org/.",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "How to debug view layouts in Xcode",
  "desc": "View debugging lets you visualize exactly how your app is drawing to the screen by exploding your UI into 3D. So, if you're sure you added a button but you just can't see it, view debugging is for you: you can spin your interface around inside Xcode, and you'll probably find your button lurking behind another view because of a bug.",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "How to load assets from Xcode asset catalogs",
  "desc": "Xcode asset catalogs are a smart and efficient way to bring together your artwork in a single place. But they are also optimized for performance: when your app is built, your assets converted to an optimized binary format for faster loading, so they are recommended for all kinds of apps unless you have a specific reason to avoid them. (Note: SpriteKit games should texture atlases if possible.",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "How to lock Interface Builder controls to stop accidental changes",
  "desc": "Interface Builder is the standard tool for making iOS interfaces using drag and drop, but it does make it remarkably easy to make a mistake - moving a view by accident, adjusting a property with a typo, or perhaps embedding one view inside another by dragging.",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "How to make Xcode play sounds while debugging",
  "desc": "Xcode has lots of tools to help you debug user interface problems, but it’s a little tricker to debug things you can’t see - network requests failing, data loading code going wrong, and so on.",

  "title": "How to render example content using prepareForInterfaceBuilder()",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "How to use storyboard references to simplify your storyboards",
  "desc": "Storyboards deliver useful features, such as being able to see a lot of your user interface side-by-side and being able to design static cell designs for your table and collection views. However, they can also cause havoc with teams, because two developers attempting to modify the storyboard at the same time will immediately hit source control problems.",

  "title": "How to use vector images in your asset catalog",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "How to used a named UIColor in code and Interface Builder",
  "desc": "Since Xcode 9.0 we’ve been able to create named colors directly inside asset catalogs, which means it’s possible to select a precise color once then use it uniformly across all code and storyboards.",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "What are breakpoints?",
  "desc": "Breakpoints are locations in your code where Xcode will pause so that you can inspect the state of your program. They don’t have any impact on the final performance of your code - in fact, they don’t even exist in your code at all - so there’s no harm using them liberally.",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "What are Swift error breakpoints?",
  "desc": "Xcode has a few special breakpoint types, accessed by going to the breakpoint navigator (Cmd+8) then clicking + in the bottom-left corner. One of the options in that menu is Swift Error Breakpoint, and it allows Xcode to pause when Swift errors are thrown.",

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "What are watchpoints?",
  "desc": "You’re probably already familiar with Xcode’s breakpoints, which allow you to pause code when a certain point is reached. Watchpoints also let you pause code, but their job is to pause when a variable is changed anywhere else in your code - it’s like a property observer, except implemented entirely using Xcode’s debugger.",

}
```

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "What is an IBOutlet?",
  "desc": "When you connect your storyboard to your code Xcode inserts two special markers: <code>@IBAction</code> and <code>@IBOutlet</code>. Both of these effectively do nothing when you build your app, but they are still important because Xcode uses them to understand which of your properties and methods are relevant to Interface Builder.",
