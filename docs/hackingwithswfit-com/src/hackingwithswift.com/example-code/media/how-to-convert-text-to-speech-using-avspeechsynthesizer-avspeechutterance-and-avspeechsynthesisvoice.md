<!-- 
If you're looking for text-to-speech conversion, it's baked right into iOS thanks to the `AVSpeechSynthesizer` class and its friends. As you can tell from the "AV" part of its name, you'll need to add AVFoundation to your project, like this:

```swift
import AVFoundation
```

With that done, you can speak whatever you want. For example, to say "Hello world" in a very slow British accent, use this:

```swift
let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: "Hello world")
utterance.voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice(language: "en-GB")
utterance.rate = 0.1 

let synthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()
synthesizer.speak(utterance)
```

You can omit the `rate` property entirely to have a natural-speed voice, or change the language to "en-US" (English, American accent), "en-IE" (English, Irish accent), "en-AU" (English, Australian accent) or whichever other accents Apple chooses to add in the future.
