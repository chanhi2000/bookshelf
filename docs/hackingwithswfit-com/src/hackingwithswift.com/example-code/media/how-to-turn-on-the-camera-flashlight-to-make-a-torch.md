There is one simple property required to enable or disable a device's torch, but you do need to put in some wrapper code to make it work safely. Specifically, you need to use the `lockForConfiguration()` and `unlockForConfiguration()` methods of the `AVCaptureDevice` class in order to make sure only one app can control the torch at a time.

You will need to import the AVFoundation framework, because that's where the `AVCaptureDevice` class comes from. Once that's done, add this function to your code and you're good to code:

```swift
func toggleTorch(on: Bool) {
    guard let device = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else { return }

    if device.hasTorch {
        do {
            try device.lockForConfiguration()

            if on == true {
                device.torchMode = .on
            } else {
                device.torchMode = .off
            }

            device.unlockForConfiguration()
        } catch {
            print("Torch could not be used")
        }
    } else {
        print("Torch is not available")
    }
}
```

With that, you can now turn the torch on like this:

```swift
toggleTorch(on: true)
```
