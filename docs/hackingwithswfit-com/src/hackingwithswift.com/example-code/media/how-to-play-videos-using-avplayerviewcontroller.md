`AVPlayerViewController` is designed to make it easy to play media just like Apple’s own apps. You can play movies and audio, local and remote, and you benefit from the same user interface layout used elsewhere in the system.

Using the class only takes a few steps, starting with importing the AVKit framework and creating a `URL` that points to the movie you want to play. Once that’s done, you create an `AVPlayer` instance pointing at your URL, send that in to an `AVPlayerViewController`, then call `play()` on it when you’re ready.

Here’s some example code to get you started:
