iOS has a built-in QR code generator, but it's a bit tricksy to use because it's exposed as a Core Image filter that needs various settings to be applied. Also, it generates codes where every bit is just one pixel across, which looks terrible if you try to stretch it inside an image view.

So, here's a simple function that wraps up QR code generation while also scaling up the QR code so it's a respectable size:

```swift
func generateQRCode(from string: String) -> UIImage? {
    let data = string.data(using: String.Encoding.ascii)

    if let filter = CIFilter(name: "CIQRCodeGenerator") {
        filter.setValue(data, forKey: "inputMessage")
        let transform = CGAffineTransform(scaleX: 3, y: 3)

        if let output = filter.outputImage?.transformed(by: transform) {
            return UIImage(ciImage: output)
        }
    }

    return nil
}

let image = generateQRCode(from: "Hacking with Swift is the best iOS coding tutorial I've ever read!")
```
