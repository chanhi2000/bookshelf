<!-- 
Delegates are extremely common in iOS development, but fortunately they are easy to understand: a delegate is any object that should be notified when something interesting has happened. What that "something interesting" means depends on the context: for example, a table view's delegate gets notified when the user taps on a row, whereas a navigation controller's delegate gets notified when the user moves between view controllers.

When you agree to be the delegate for an object, you will almost certainly need to conform to a specific protocol, such as `UITableViewDelegate`. These protocols will usually have some optional methods that you can implement if you care when something happens, for example, table views can notify you when users *deselect* a row, but most developers don't care. These protocols may also have some required methods that you *must* implement.
