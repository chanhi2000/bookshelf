<!-- 
Selectors are effectively the names of methods on an object or struct, and they are used to execute some code at runtime. They were common in Objective-C, but the earliest versions of Swift didn't include some core selector functionality so their use declined for a while. That functionality (things like `performSelector(inBackground:)`) has since been restored.

In Swift, selectors are most commonly found when working with the target/action paradigm that you find in classes such as `Timer` and `UIBarButtonItem`. For example, when you create a timer you need to tell it who to notify when the timer fires (the target) and what selector should be called (the action). The same goes for bar button items: when the button is tapped, what selector should be called, and on what object?
