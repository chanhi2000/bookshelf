<!-- 
In Swift we normally loop over arrays like this:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers {
    print(number)
}
```

However, Swift provides us an alternative: a dedicated array method called `forEach()`, that loops over each item in the array and does something with it. For example, the above loop would be written like this:

```swift
numbers.forEach {
    print($0)
}
```

The difference is that `forEach()` can’t skip over any items - you can’t exit the loop part way, without processing the rest of the items. This helps people reading your code to figure out your intent: you want to act on all items, and won’t stop in the middle.
