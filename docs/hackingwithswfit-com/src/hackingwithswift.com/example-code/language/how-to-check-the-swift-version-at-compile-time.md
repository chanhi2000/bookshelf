<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
Swift gives us the `#if swift` build configuration option, which lets you compile certain code only if a specific version of the Swift compiler is detected. This is particularly useful for libraries that need to support multiple incompatible versions of Swift at the same time, because only one version of their code will ever be compiled.

In the example below, the `print()` code will display one of two messages depending on whether you're using an old version of Swift:

```swift
#if swift(>=5.0)
print("Running Swift 5.0 or later")
#else
print("Running old Swift")
#endif
```
