<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
Swift 2.0 introduced a lot of major language changes. You can read my full article explaining the changes with code examples <a href="/swift2">by clicking here</a>, but here are the highlights:

- Checked exceptions using `try/catch`
<li>Automatically synthesized headers
<li>The `guard` keyword to check input while unwrapping optionals
<li>Measuring strings is now done using `characters.count` (Note: this was later un-done in Swift 4.)
<li>Delayed code execution using the `defer` keyword
<li>You now get mutability warnings if you declare variables that never get changed
<li>API availability checking is now built right in
<li>The `performSelector()` family of functions is now available
