<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
Swift 2.2 introduced a lot of major language changes. You can read my full article explaining the changes with code examples <a href="/swift2-2">by clicking here</a>, but here are the highlights:

- You can now compare tuples up to arity 6
<li>Compile-time Swift version checking
<li>More keywords can be used as argument labels
<li>Renamed debug identifiers: #line, #function, #file
<li>The ++ and -- operators are deprecated
<li>Traditional C-style for loops are deprecated
<li>Tuple splat syntax is deprecated
<li>var parameters have been deprecated
<li>Stringified selectors are deprecated
<li>New documentation keywords: recommended, recommendedover, and keyword
