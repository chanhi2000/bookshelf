<!-- 
The `Never` return type is a special one in Swift, and tells the compiler that execution will never return when this function is called. It’s used by Swift’s `fatalError()` and `preconditionFailure()` functions, both of which cause your app to crash if they are called.

The `Never` return type is useful because it lets Swift waive other requirements. For example, if you’re in a function that must return a value, calling a `Never` function means you don’t need to return anything - Swift knows you can’t return a value any more.
