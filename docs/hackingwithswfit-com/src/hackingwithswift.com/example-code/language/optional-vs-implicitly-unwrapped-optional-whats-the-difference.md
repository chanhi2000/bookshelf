When you’re just learning Swift, the difference between an optional (`String?`), an implicitly unwrapped optional (`String!`), and a regular type (`String`) can seem awfully confusing. Here’s a quick summary that should explain the difference:

When you use `String` you’re saying this will always have a string inside, and can never have nothing inside. It might be an empty string (`""`), but even an empty string is still a string.

When you use `String?` you’re saying this might have a string inside, but it might have nothing at all inside - not even an empty string. Swift won’t let you use these without unwrapping them, which is usually done using `if let`.

When you use `String!` you’re saying this might have a string inside, but it might have nothing at all inside - not even an empty string. However, Swift lets you use these as if they were a `String`, as if they always *do* have a value, but if you try to use a nil value by accident your code will crash. This effectively lets you say “I know this *might* be nil, but I’m so sure it has a value that I’m willing for my program to crash if I’m wrong.”

So: `String` is definitely a string, `String?` might be nil or might be a string, and `String!` might be nil but when you use it you’re absolutely sure it has a string.
