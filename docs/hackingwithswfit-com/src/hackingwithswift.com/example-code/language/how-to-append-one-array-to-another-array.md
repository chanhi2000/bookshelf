<!-- 
There are three ways of adding one array to another, and you can use whichever syntax you prefer.

First, make a couple of test arrays to work with:

```swift
var first = ["John", "Paul"]
let second = ["George", "Ringo"]
```

**Note:** I made the `first` array mutable so we can join the second array to it.

One option for joining arrays is the `append(contentsOf:)` method, used like this:

```swift
first.append(contentsOf: second)
```

Another option is using the `+=` operator, which is overloaded for arrays to combine elements:

```swift
first += second
```

The third option is to use a regular `+` to create a new array by combining two others:

```swift
let third = first + second
```

All three options produce the same resulting array, albeit with different approaches.
