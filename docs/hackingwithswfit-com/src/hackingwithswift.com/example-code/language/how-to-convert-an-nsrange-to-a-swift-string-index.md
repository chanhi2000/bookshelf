Swift strings have changed in every release since the language was first announced, but even after so much change its older counterpart, `NSRange`, still appears in many UIKit APIs. 

Fortunately, Swift 4 introduced a simple way to convert any `NSRange` into a regular Swift `Range`. For example, say you had the following string and range:

```swift
let input = "Hello, world"
let range = NSMakeRange(0, 10)
```

To make that into a Swift `Range` instance you just need this single line of code:

```swift
let swiftRange = Range(range, in: input)
```
