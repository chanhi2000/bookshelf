<!-- 
Most angles in iOS are measured using radians rather than degrees, but the majority of users prefer to see degrees so you’ll need to do some conversion. The equation to convert between the two is simple enough: multiply the number by 180, then divide the result by Pi.

To make things easier, drop in this function:

```swift
func rad2deg(_ number: Double) -> Double {
    return number * 180 / .pi
}
```

You can now use `rad2deg(5)` to find 5 radians in degrees.
