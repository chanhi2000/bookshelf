<!-- 
A regular `for-in` loop goes over all the items in an array, allowing you to manipulate them as you need. However, sometimes you don’t need *all* items and instead only want a subset, and in those circumstances the `where` keyword is useful.

For example, consider this array:

```swift
let names = ["Michael Jackson", "Taylor Swift", "Michael Caine", "Adele Adkins", "Michael Jordan"]
```

A regular `for-in` loop could print out all those names, but by adding a `where` clause we could restrict the loop so it operates only on people named Michael:

```swift
for name in names where name.hasPrefix("Michael") {
    print(name)
}
```

If you need multiple conditions in your `where` clause, join them using `&&`.
