<!-- 
The `reduce()` method is designed to convert a sequence into a single value, which makes it perfect for calculating the total of an array of numbers.

For example, given the following number array:

```swift
let numbers = [1, 12, 2, 9, 27]
```

We could calculate the total of all those numbers like this:

```swift
let total = numbers.reduce(0, +)
```

The first parameter passed to `reduce()` is the value it should start with, in this case 0. The second parameter is how it should combine that 0 with each item in your array, which means it will do 0 + 1 to make 1, then 1 + 12 to make 13, and so on.
