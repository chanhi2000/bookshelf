<!-- 
`KeyValuePairs`, somewhat confusingly known as `DictionaryLiteral` before Swift 5.0, is a useful data type that provides dictionary-like functionality with a handful of benefits:

- Your keys don’t need to conform to `Hashable`.
<li>You can add items with duplicate keys.
<li>The order in which you add items is preserved.

However, because `KeyValuePairs` doesn’t require its keys to be hashable, you don’t get the fast key look up of a regular dictionary - it’s O(*n*) rather than O(1) if you like Big O notation. Instead, you access them like an array, using numerical indexes.

As an example, here’s a `KeyValuePairs` instance holding the name of a singer:

```swift
let singer: KeyValuePairs = ["firstName": "Taylor", "lastName": "Swift"]
```

If we wanted to access the key name and value for the first item, we’d write something like this:

```swift
print("\(singer[0].key) is set to \(singer[0].value)")
```

Even better, because `KeyValuePairs` inherits from the `Sequence` protocol we can loop over all keys and values, like this:

```swift
for value in singer {
    print("\(value.key) is set to \(value.value)")
}
```
