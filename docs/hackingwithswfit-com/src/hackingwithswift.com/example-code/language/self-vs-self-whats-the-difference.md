<!-- 
When you’re writing protocols and protocol extensions, there’s a difference between `Self` (capital S) and `self` (lowercase S). When used with a capital S, `Self` refers to the type that conform to the protocol, e.g. `String` or `Int`. When used with a lowercase S, `self` refers to the value inside that type, e.g. “hello” or 556.

As an example, consider this extension on `BinaryInteger`:

```swift
extension BinaryInteger {
    func squared() -> Self {
        return self * self
    }
}
```

Remember, `Self` with a capital S refers to whatever type is conforming to the protocol. In the example above, `Int` conforms to `BinaryInteger`, so when called on `Int` the method returns an `Int`.

On the other hand, `self` with a *lowercase* S refers to whatever value the type holds. If the example above were called on an `Int` storing the value 5 it would effectively be `5 * 5`.
