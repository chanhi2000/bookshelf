<!-- 
Swift has two anonymous types: `Any` and `AnyObject`. They are subtly different, and you will need to use both sooner or later.

`AnyObject` refers to any instance of a class, and is equivalent to `id` in Objective-C. It’s useful when you specifically want to work with a reference type, because it won’t allow any of Swift’s structs or enums to be used. `AnyObject` is also used when you want to restrict a protocol so that it can be used only with classes.

`Any` refers to any instance of a class, struct, or enum - literally anything at all. You’ll see this in Swift wherever types are unknown or are mixed in ways that can be meaningfully categorized:

```swift
let values: [Any] = [1, 2, "Fish"]
```

Ideally you should avoid both `Any` and `AnyObject` in your code - it’s better to be more specific if you can be.
