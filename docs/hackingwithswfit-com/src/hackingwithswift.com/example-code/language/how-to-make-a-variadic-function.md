<!-- 
Variadic functions are functions that accept any number of parameters. The most common one in Swift is `print()` - most people use it to print a single value, but you can actually pass as many as you want, like this:

```swift
print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

To make a variadic function of your own, just add `...` after any parameter. For example, we could write a `sum()` function that accepts any number of integers and adds them together, like this:

```swift
func sum1(_ numbers: Int...) -> Int {
    var total = 0

    for number in numbers {
        total += number
    }

    return total
}
```

Or if you wanted to write that functionally, you would use `reduce()`:

```swift
func sum2(_ numbers: Int...) -> Int {
    return numbers.reduce(0, +)
}
```

Notice how we specify `Int...` rather than `Int` - that means this function can be called using no integers, one integer, or even a hundred integers, and Swift will automatically convert them to be an array of integers inside the function.

So, it would be called like this:

```swift
let total = sum2(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
