<!-- 
If you have an array of items and want to find the first item that matches a specific condition, you should use the `index(where:)` method. This accepts a closure of code to use as a test, applies that test to all elements in an array, then returns the index of the first item to match it. If no item matches you’ll get back nil, so be prepared to unwrap the optional you get sent back.

For example, if we had an array of numbers:

```swift
let numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]
```

We could find the first odd number like this:

```swift
let firstOdd = numbers.index { $0 % 2 == 1 }
```

That will send back 4 as an optional integer, because the first odd number (9) is at index four.
