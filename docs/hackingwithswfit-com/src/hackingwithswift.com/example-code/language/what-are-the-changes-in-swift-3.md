<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
Swift 3.0 introduced the biggest changes to the language since it was released, and it’s 100% guaranteed to cause your current code to break unless you had written some extraordinarily trivial apps.

I went over the changes in more detail in my article <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/swift3">What’s new in Swift 3.0?</a>, but here are the headline changes:

- All function parameters have labels unless you request otherwise.
<li>Needless or duplicated words in method names have been removed.
<li>UpperCamelCase has been replaced with lowerCamelCase for enums and properties.
<li>C functions from Core Graphics and GCD have been replaced with method syntax.
<li>Everything deprecated in Swift 2.2 has now been removed from the language.
<li>Closures are now considered to be non-escaping by default; if you need them to escape you need to use the new `@escaping` attribute.
<li>Key paths (for KVO) can now be specified using the `#keyPath` directive.
<li>Many Foundation types have been converted to structs; most have dropped their “NS” name prefix.
<li>Many closure parameters now have default values, so you don’t need to write `completion: nil` much any more.
