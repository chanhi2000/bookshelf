<!-- 
A functor is any data type that can be mapped over using `map()`, as long it abides by two laws:

1. If your map function is the identity function (i.e. it just returns each element without transformation) then your input and output must be the same.
<li>If you compose function A and function B to make function C then use the result with `map()`, the result should be the same as mapping first A then B individually.

Both of those laws sound obvious, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t important. Arrays are functors, sets are functors, optionals are functors, and more.
