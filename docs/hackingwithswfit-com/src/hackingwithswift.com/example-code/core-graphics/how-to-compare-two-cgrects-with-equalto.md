<!-- 
You could compare two `CGRect` values by evaluating their X, Y, width and height values, but there's a much faster way: `equalTo()`. This takes two rects as its only two parameters and returns true if they are the same, or false otherwise.

Here's an example:

```swift
let rect1 = CGRect(x: 64, y: 64, width: 128, height: 128)
let rect2 = CGRect(x: 256, y: 256, width: 128, height: 128)

if rect1.equalTo(rect2) {
    // rects equal!
} else {
    // rects not equal
}
```
