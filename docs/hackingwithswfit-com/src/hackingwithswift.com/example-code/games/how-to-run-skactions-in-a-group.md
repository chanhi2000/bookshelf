<!-- 
SpriteKit action groups let you run multiple SpriteKit actions simultaneously. The grouped actions become a new action that can go into a sequence, and SpriteKit automatically ensures all actions in a group finish before the sequence continues.

The code below makes a spaceship shrink down to 10% of its original size while fading out, with both actions happening at the same time:

```swift
let sprite = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed:"Spaceship")

let scale = SKAction.scale(to: 0.1, duration: 0.5)
let fade = SKAction.fadeOut(withDuration: 0.5)
let group = SKAction.group([scale, fade])

sprite.run(group)
```
