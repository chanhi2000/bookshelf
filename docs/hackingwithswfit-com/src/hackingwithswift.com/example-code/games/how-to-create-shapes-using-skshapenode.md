<!-- 
SpriteKit's `SKShapeNode` class is a fast and convenient way to draw arbitrary shapes in your games, including circles, lines, rounded rectangles and more. You can assign a fill color, a stroke color and width, plus other drawing options such as whether it should glow - yes, really.

The example code below draws a rounded rectangle smack in the middle of the game scene, giving it a red fill color and a 10-point blue border:

```swift
let shape = SKShapeNode()
shape.path = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: CGRect(x: -128, y: -128, width: 256, height: 256), cornerRadius: 64).cgPath
shape.position = CGPoint(x: frame.midX, y: frame.midY)
shape.fillColor = UIColor.red
shape.strokeColor = UIColor.blue
shape.lineWidth = 10
addChild(shape)
```
