AI is quickly changing the way we work, and more and more companies are using it to help them get and retain clients. Teams are also using AI to create innovative and responsive websites capable of engaging visitors while also providing helpful information.

AI agents are powerful tools for customer services. Having them power your platforms and websites might sound like an expensive proposition with high technical expertise required. But with the emergence of new modern platforms like Agno and Groq, it’s now easier to integrate an AI agent system into your website while still staying within budget.

In this article, you’ll go through the process of developing your own AI agent ecosystem (for free). This will enable you to have a website that can handle customer enquiries, create content, analyse a user's behaviour, and provide custom personal experiences for each user. It's a fantastic setup because you can automate part of your business, speeding up lead generation and freeing up your time to work on more high-priority tasks.

This article is for developers who are familiar with JavaScript, React, and Python. Even if you don’t have a complete understanding of all three, as long as you are a beginner or junior with some knowledge, you should be able to understand at least some of the code. For example, JavaScript and Python are pretty similar syntax-wise, so if you have experience with either of them, then just reading through the codebase will give you an idea of how everything works.

For this tutorial, we’ll build a portfolio website. But you can use the ideas and concepts you learn here for any type of website, regardless of whether you are a solo entrepreneur or part of a large company. With these tools and frameworks, it's possible to transform your web presence without going over budget.

::: note Prerequisites

- Prior knowledge of JavaScript, React, and Python
- [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>Python](https://python.org/) installed and setup locally on your computer
- An account on [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-groq"/>Groq Cloud](https://groq.com/)
- A code editor/IDE installed like [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Cursor](https://cursor.com/en), [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), or [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-vscode"/>VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are computer systems or programs that are designed to use artificial intelligence to interact with their world and achieve certain objectives. They are able to perceive their world - through sensors, user input, or data - and act to achieve goals, typically with some degree of autonomy. This means that they will decide things for themselves, sometimes with little to no human intervention, depending on how they were designed.

## What are Agno and Groq Cloud?

Agno is a lightweight library that lets you build Multimodal Agents. It’s an AI inference engine designed to optimise LLMs for speed and performance. This means it can provide super-fast AI model inference with reduced latency and improved resource utilisation. It has the potential to replace current inference platforms like NVIDIA TensorRT or Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference (TGI).

Groq Cloud is a cloud-based AI inference platform based on Groq LPU (Language Processing Unit) chips, which are optimised for ultra-low-latency AI workloads. Groq is great at high-speed token generation rates, making it perfect for real-time AI applications like chatbots, AI coding help, and other latency-sensitive workloads. The Groq Cloud platform offers free access to its large language models (LLMs) through a free tier, but there are some usage limits.

If you go to the [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-gro"/>Groq Cloud Playground](https://console.groq.com/playground) you can find LLM models from different companies like:

- Qwen
- DeepSeek R1
- Google Gemma 2
- Hugging Face
- Meta llama
- Mistral AI
- OpenAI

This is great because Groq Cloud gives us the flexibility to choose from any of these AI LLM models for our AI agent application. Agno basically acts as the orchestration layer for multiple AI agents. In our case, that would be WelcomeAgent, ProjectAgent, CareerAgent, BusinessAdvisor and ResearchAgent.

The platform is able to manage their conversations, task delegation, and memory. When any of our AI agents need to reason or generate output, Agno then uses Groq Cloud, which can run large language models (LLMs), and it does this with ultra-low latency. The advantage to this is that it ensures that it has fast and efficient responses. Groq Cloud itself is not an LLM - rather, it is a high-performance inference engine which hosts and serves LLMs from lots of different providers.

For this project, we will use Meta’s LLaMA 3 model because it strikes a strong balance between performance and accuracy and is openly accessible. This means that it is well-suited for the AI agents in our portfolio website.

It's worth mentioning that we could have used the LLaMA model from [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-meta"/>llama.com](http://llama.com). Still, instead we will use it via Groq Cloud, because, this way, we get better optimisation, more capabilities, and better-quality responses for each AI agent. This is because Groq Cloud gives us the flexibility to test and choose between different AI models if we wish to do so, and that means that we can get the best one for our needs.

## What You Will Be Building

Today, you will be building a portfolio website that incorporates AI agents with which anyone can interact. These AI agents are like customer service representatives because anyone can ask them questions about your skills and portfolio, and they will provide the person with information.

This is great because it means that potential clients can learn anything about you 24/7 without having actually to talk to you when you are unavailable. You could even use this portfolio as a template for building your portfolio website or as inspiration for creating one.

In total, there will be five AI agents on your portfolio website:

- WelcomeAgent: a specialist in helping users navigate the website, whether the user is an employer, client, or fellow programmer
- ProjectAgent: a project specialist that can provide information about projects, technology, and challenges
- CareerAgent: a career specialist that can provide information about skills, experience, and professional background
- BusinessAdvisor: a client specialist that can provide information about services, pricing, and project details
- ResearchAgent: a research specialist that can provide information about technology, trends, and industry news

The massive benefit of incorporating AI agents into a portfolio website is that they can create a personalised experience by providing an interactive experience which is tailor-made and not as easily replicated on other, more generic websites.

This can set your website apart because, as opposed to having a static website for showcasing your talent, an AI agent is capable of guiding visitors, answering queries about your projects, and recommending relevant work based on an interest.

Another great feature is the ability to simulate a conversation, which can make the portfolio feel more dynamic, engaging, and immersive while also demonstrating how good you are at working with modern tooling.

All of this combined provides you with a practical and approachable way to explore AI agents. This can be a real-world example and a personal project that does not require the implementation of a full-scale business application to see how valuable this type of concept can be.

The website will have the following six pages:

- Home - the main webpage
- Projects - showcasing some featured projects and technical skills
- Career - showing skills, experience, education, and certifications
- Services - client services and the engagement process
- Research - a way to search the web regarding the tech industry
- Contact - a page with a form to contact the user

You can see what your frontend React application will look like below:

![First, you have your portfolio homepage:](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741977313487/4ac8fd65-4d3a-4da1-80b8-4b4ff5136e7e.png)
