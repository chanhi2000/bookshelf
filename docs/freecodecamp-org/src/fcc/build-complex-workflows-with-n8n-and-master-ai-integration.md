n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform that lets you connect different apps, APIs, and services to easily automate tasks without needing to implement extensive code.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed to take you from a beginner to a capable developer, harnessing n8n's power to build sophisticated real-world solutions. Gavin Lon developed this course.

Gavin starts by discussing essential internet standards like REST and OAuth2 that make secure integrations possible, setting the foundation for your automation journey. You'll learn the practical steps of setting up n8n and then dive into four comprehensive workflow examples, including an AI-powered chatbot and an emergency WhatsApp notification system. Gavin will guide you step-by-step through creating these solutions, demonstrating how to seamlessly integrate diverse services like WhatsApp, Google Sheets, and AI agents.

Here are all the sections in the course:

- Introduction
- Discussing Internet Standards, REST and OAuth2
- Getting Started - Setup n8n on Hostinger (self-hosted)
- Create First Workflow Example (AI - Chatbot)
- Add an AIAgent Node to Workflow
- Add OpenAI Chat Model sub node to AiAgent Node
- Add Credentials to OpenAI Chat Model sub node
- Add a System Prompt to AIAgent Node
- Add Memory Sub Node to AiAgent (to Add Context)
- Test ChatBot WorkFlow
- Logging on to Hostinger and n8n
- Create Workflow Example 2 (WhatsApp Panic App Registration)
- Create Google Spreadsheet
- Add and Setup OnSubmission Form Trigger Node
- Add and Setup Google Sheets Node
- Setup Credentials for Google Sheets Node (using OAuth2)
- Create Workflow Example 3 (WhatsApp Panic Notifications)
- Add WhatsApp Trigger Node and Setup Credentials
- Setup other Workflow Nodes (WhatsApp Panic Notifications)
- Test WhatsApp Panic App Notifications Workflow
- Create Workflow Example 4 (CV Approval / Interview Scheduler)
- Setup Google Drive Node and Configure Credentials
- Setup Loop Node
- Setup Human in the Loop Node
- Setup AIAgent Node for Scheduling Interview on Google Calendar
- Test CV Approval / Interview Scheduler Workflow - Human in the Loop
- Abstract Sub-WorkFlow to Create Separation of Concerns
- Extra Information
- Use WhatsApp to Converse with ChatBot in Example 1
- Use A WebHook Trigger Node to Trigger your Workflow
- Use the HttpRequest node to make Requests to External Web Apis From Workflow
- Integrate JavaScript Code into Workflow using Code Node
- Outro
