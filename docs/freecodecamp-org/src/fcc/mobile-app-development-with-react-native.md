## Why Learn React Native?

React Native is a popular framework because it allows you to use JavaScript—a widely used programming language—to build mobile apps. This means you can transition from web development to mobile development without needing to learn a completely new language. Plus, React Native’s community and ecosystem are rich with resources, making it easier for beginners to find support and tools.
