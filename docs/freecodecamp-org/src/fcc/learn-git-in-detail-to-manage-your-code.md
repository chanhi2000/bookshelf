Version control is an essential skill for anyone involved in software development, from solo hobbyists to professional developers working in large teams. Understanding how to effectively manage changes and collaborate on code is critical, and Git is the most widely used version control system in the industry.

We just released a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that is designed for beginners to master the basics of Git. Hitesh Choudhary created this course. Hitesh is a popular instructor with almost 900,000 subscribers on his channel.

## Why Learn Git?

Git allows you to track changes in your software projects, collaborate with others, and revert to previous states of your project whenever needed. It's a powerful tool that helps prevent conflicts and miscommunication between team members and preserves the integrity of your projects by ensuring that changes can be audited and reviewed.
