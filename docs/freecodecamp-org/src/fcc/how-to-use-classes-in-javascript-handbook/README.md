Are you curious about classes in JavaScript but feel a little puzzled about how they work or why you'd even use them? If that's you, then you're definitely in the right place. Lots of developers find classes a bit tricky at first, and honestly, I was once there too.

This article is for you if any of these sounds familiar:

- JavaScript is your first programming language.
- You are new to, or not entirely comfortable with, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- You have primarily used functions for structuring your JavaScript code.

If you're nodding along to any of these, then keep reading.

In this article, we'll take a step-by-step approach, showing you how object-oriented programming is implemented in JavaScript with objects and constructor functions, and clearly illustrate why understanding and using classes will make you a more versatile and effective JavaScript developer, even if you’re used to writing everything in functions. We’ll end everything with a simple to-do app example so you can see how to use classes.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve built a basic, interactive to-do app using JavaScript classes and HTML. You now see how classes help you organize code and encapsulate related functionality. While classes are just syntactic sugar over prototypes, they make it much easier to write, read, and maintain your code—especially as your applications grow.

Your next step? Experiment with the prototype approach and compare it with the class-based approach. The more you code, the more natural these concepts will become. Happy coding, and keep building cool stuff.
