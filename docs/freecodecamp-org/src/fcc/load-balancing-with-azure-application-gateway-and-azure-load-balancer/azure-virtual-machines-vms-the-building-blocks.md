When it comes to running apps in the cloud, **Virtual Machines (VMs)** are the basic building blocks - kind of like renting an apartment in a giant digital skyscraper.

You don‚Äôt need to buy the whole building (aka physical servers), you just rent the space you need, when you need it.

## What Exactly Is a Virtual Machine?

A Virtual Machine is a software-based computer that runs inside a real, physical computer (a server) - hosted in a data center, like those run by Microsoft Azure.

It looks and behaves like a normal computer:

- It has an operating system (Windows, Linux)
- You can install apps
- It has memory (RAM), storage (disks), and CPU

But the best part? You don‚Äôt need to worry about the hardware. Azure takes care of that behind the scenes - all you do is say:

> ‚ÄúHey Azure, give me a Linux VM with 4GB RAM and 2 CPUs.‚Äù

And boom üí• ‚Äî it spins up in minutes.

## Why Use a VM?

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve built a web app - it‚Äôs just a simple blog. You want to deploy it and make it accessible to the world.

Here's what you can do with a VM:

- Set it up with your favorite OS (for example, Ubuntu)
- Install web servers like Nginx or Apache
- Deploy your app
- Bind it to your domain name
- Let the world visit your blog at `myawesomeblog.com`

It‚Äôs your own personal environment - no sharing, full control.
