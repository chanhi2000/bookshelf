GitHub Codespaces gives you a full development environment in the cloud, directly in your browser. It‚Äôs great for writing and running code, but there‚Äôs one big limitation: it doesn‚Äôt support graphical applications out of the box, especially for Python code.

If you try to run a Python GUI library like Pygame, Tkinter, or PyQt inside Codespaces, you‚Äôll get an error. That‚Äôs because Codespaces runs in a headless environment. There‚Äôs no physical display for your app to open a window on.

In this article, I‚Äôll show you how to fix that. You‚Äôll learn how to set up a virtual desktop using Xvfb and stream it into your browser using noVNC. By the end, you‚Äôll be able to run any Python GUI application inside GitHub Codespaces.

::: note Prerequisites

Before you start, you should have:

- A GitHub account and access to GitHub Codespaces.
- Basic familiarity with Python.
- A Python GUI app to test (we‚Äôll use a small Pygame example).

:::

## Why Codespaces Needs Extra Setup for GUIs

When you run GUI code like:

```py
import pygame
pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
```

On your local machine, Python tells your operating system to create a window. But Codespaces runs on a server with no monitor attached. Without a display, your GUI app cannot render.

That‚Äôs where [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Xvfb](https://x.org/archive/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) (X virtual framebuffer) comes in. It simulates a display in memory, so GUI programs think they‚Äôre running on a real screen. To make that screen visible in the browser, you can use [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>noVNC](https://novnc.com/info.html), which streams the virtual display through a web client.

Together, Xvfb and noVNC turn Codespaces into a cloud-based desktop for GUI apps.

---

## Step 1: Create the Repo and Open Codespace

First, create a GitHub repository for your project (or a demo repo) and open it in Codespaces:

![Screenshot of a new repository](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757336978616/4a41c394-0d85-48de-b7d6-14a0a3dae56d.jpeg)

---

## Step 2: Add the Setup Script

Create a file called <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-shell"/>`start-gui.sh` in the root of your project.

![a screenshot of GitHub codespace with a bash file created](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757337705472/b1b75b17-57b9-437c-a79e-18f6b1f55cae.png)

Paste the following code into the <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-shell"/>`start-gui.sh` file:

```sh title="start-gui.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

echo "Installing dependencies..."
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y xvfb x11vnc fluxbox websockify novnc

echo "Starting virtual display..."
Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &
export DISPLAY=:1
fluxbox &

echo "Starting VNC server..."
x11vnc -display :1 -nopw -forever -shared -rfbport 5900 &

echo "Starting noVNC on port 6080..."
websockify --web=/usr/share/novnc 6080 localhost:5900 &

echo ""
echo "GUI environment is ready!"
echo "Go to the Ports tab, set port 6080 to Public, and open the link."
```

Let‚Äôs explain this script so you can understand what it does:

### `set -e`

- This tells the shell to exit immediately if any command fails.
- Without it, the script would keep running even if something goes wrong (like a failed install).

### Installing Dependencies

- `sudo apt-get update -y`: updates your package list.
- `sudo apt-get install -y`: ‚Å£installs the packages we listed (xvfb, x11vnc, fluxbox, websockify, and novnc)
- **xvfb**: creates a ‚Äúdummy‚Äù display (virtual screen in memory).
- **x11vnc**: shares that dummy display via the VNC protocol.
- **Fluxbox:** a lightweight window manager, so the desktop has a GUI environment.
- **websockify**: converts VNC traffic into WebSockets so it can run in a browser.
- **novnc**: provides a browser client to connect to the desktop.

### Virtual Display

- `Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &`: Starts the virtual framebuffer on display `:1` with resolution `1024x768` and 24-bit color.
- `export DISPLAY=:1`: tells apps (like Python GUIs) to draw on this virtual screen instead of looking for a real display unit.
- `fluxbox &`: launches the window manager so GUI apps have a desktop to sit in.

### VNC Server

- `x11vnc -display :1`: connects you to the dummy display (`:1`).
- `-nopw`: ensures that no password is required.
- `-forever`: this keeps the VNC running even if clients disconnect.
- `-shared`: allows multiple clients.
- `-rfbport 5900`: exposes the internal server on VNC‚Äôs standard port.

### noVNC Server

- `websockify` acts as a bridge that converts WebSocket traffic to VNC protocol (on port 5900).
- `--web=/usr/share/novnc`: serves the noVNC web client files.
- `6080`: the port where you‚Äôll connect in your browser (this is publicly accessible).
- `localhost:5900`: forwards traffic to the VNC server that was started earlier.

You should only expose **port 6080** (noVNC) as **Public** and keep **5900** (raw VNC) private because:

- **Prt 5900 (VNC)** uses the raw VNC protocol, which is **not encrypted** and doesn‚Äôt require a password in this setup. If exposed, anyone could connect directly and control your Codespace desktop.
- **Prt 6080 (noVNC)** runs over **WebSockets + HTTPS**, so traffic is encrypted and secured through GitHub Codespaces‚Äô connection. It also only serves the noVNC web client, not the raw VNC protocol.

::: note

- `5900` = unsafe to expose
- `6080` = browser-safe way to view the GUI.

:::

The next step is for you to make the bash file executable by running the code below in the terminal:

```sh
chmod +x start-gui.sh
```

---

## Step 3: Start the GUI Environment

Run the script:

```sh
./start-gui.sh
```

![the terminal while running the bash script](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757339165120/f99b3381-d038-4eb6-944d-3fabad058c95.png)

This will:

1. Install all dependencies (Xvfb, fluxbox, x11vnc, novnc).
2. Start a virtual display (`DISPLAY=:1`).
3. Launch a lightweight window manager (fluxbox).
4. Stream the desktop to your browser via noVNC on port `6080`.

---

## Step 4: Open the noVNC Desktop

1. In Codespaces, open the Ports tab.
2. Find port 6080 and change its visibility to public. (right-click on the private word)
3. Open the URL in a new browser tab.
4. Click <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-html5"/>`vnc.html` or <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-html5"/>`vnc_auto.html` if prompted.

![screenshot of the port tab on codespace](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757339315843/e3fcfd7b-d946-4c46-b4a9-09b905574a80.png)

![open the port 6080 forwared address in a new tab, and you'd get this screen](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757339400603/d8e0e412-7669-4c41-b1e4-5f13d8125de1.png)

You should now see a lightweight Linux desktop running inside your browser.

![a light weight linux desktop running on your browser](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757339486345/f5831d0e-d66e-4549-902a-13e3c8bd8bf0.png)

---

## Step 5: Run Your Python GUI App

In a new Codespaces terminal, run:

```sh
export DISPLAY=:1
python3 your_script.py
```

Your Python GUI app should appear inside the noVNC desktop üéâ.

For example, here‚Äôs a simple Pygame script <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`test.py`:

```py :collapsed-lines title="test.py"
import pygame
from pygame import display, font, event
from pygame.locals import *

# Setup display
pygame.init()
screen = display.set_mode()
display.set_caption("Capstone 2")
myFont = font.SysFont('arial', 12)  # Choose a font to use in game

# Directions displayed throughout game
directions = "Please press the 'Y' key for yes and the 'N' key for no."

# Counts how many questions have been asked
currentQuestion = 0


# Determines which question to ask
def story(answer, count):
    screen.fill("white")
    if count == 0:
        question1(answer)
    elif count == 1:
        question2(answer)
    elif count == 2:
        question3(answer)
    elif count == 3:
        end(answer)


# Displays the first part of the story
def intro():
    # Break up the string into multiple variables because there isn't text wrapping in Pygame
    intro1 = "Once upon a time lived a brave hero named Anya."
    intro2 = "She lived a simple life in a small village, making biscuits for the village people."
    intro3 = "One day, late at night, she hears a loud noise outside the village."
    q1 = "Should she go outside to investigate? Yes or no?"

    screen.fill("white")
    textSurface = myFont.render(intro1, True, "black")
    screen.blit(textSurface, (10, 10))
    textSurface = myFont.render(intro2, True, "black")
    screen.blit(textSurface, (10, 24))
    textSurface = myFont.render(intro3, True, "black")
    screen.blit(textSurface, (10, 38))
    textSurface = myFont.render(q1, True, "black")
    screen.blit(textSurface, (10, 52))
    textSurface = myFont.render(directions, True, "black")
    screen.blit(textSurface, (10, 66))


# First question

        q2 = "Should she fight the ogres? Yes or no?"

        textSurface = myFont.render(yes1, True, "black")

        no2 = "However, the sounds do not go away."
        no3 = "She can tell something is very wrong..."

> code source: codecombat (developing python game)

The code above is a simple interactive story game written with Pygame**.** In the first few lines, you import **Pygame** and its display, font, and event modules.

`pygame.locals` brings in constants like `K_y` (Y key), `K_n` (N key), and‚Å£ `KEYDOWN`.

The preceding line then initializes Pygame and creates a window (`screen`). It also sets the window title and then loads a font for rendering the text.

Then you have the section for functions that power the story (`intro`, `question1`, `question2`, `question3`, and conditions based on the player‚Äôs answer).

In summary, the code is a choose-your-own-adventure text game with a single character, Anya. The choices of the player determine which text is shown.

To run this script, install `pygame`.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pygame
pip install pygame
```

The above code will install `pygame` into your environment, after which you can then run the script.

```sh
python3 test.py
```

When you run this inside Codespaces, the window will appear in the noVNC tab. If it doesn‚Äôt open automatically, click on `connect`.

::: tip Tips

![ALSA error in codespaces](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757340460701/c3c8376a-4b6f-4a05-8ed3-83c036476150.png)

- **Ignore ALSA errors**: Codespaces doesn‚Äôt have sound output, so audio warnings are normal.
- **Adjust resolution**: Change `1024x768x24` in the script if you want a bigger (or smaller) screen.
- **Use with other libraries**: Tkinter, PyQt, and Matplotlib interactive plots. All will work with this setup.
- **Automate DISPLAY export**: Add `export DISPLAY=:1` in your bash file if you don‚Äôt want to type it each time.
