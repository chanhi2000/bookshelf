Every developer has faced this moment: you deploy an update, everything works fine, and then that small voice in your head asks, “But is it secure?”

You have run your unit tests, your linter is happy, and the code reviews are green. Still, you know there could be something hiding in your code.

Maybe an input check you forgot. Maybe a route that exposes too much.

Traditional pentests take weeks. Static analyzers throw hundreds of false alarms. Most security tools are slow, noisy, and hard to use.

[<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`usestrix/strix`](https://github.com/usestrix/strix) changes that. It is an open-source AI hacker that acts like a real attacker.

It runs your code, probes your endpoints, and confirms vulnerabilities through actual exploitation. And the best part is, it’s built for developers.

In this article, you’ll learn how Strix works, from installation and setup to real-world vulnerability testing examples. You’ll also see how its AI agents think, how it fits into your development workflow, and what it means for the future of AI-driven security testing.

::: note Prerequisites

Before getting started with Strix, make sure you have the following in place. This ensures the setup runs smoothly and you can follow along with the examples later in the article.

- [**Basic knowledge of Python**](/freecodecamp.org/learn-python-basics.md)
- [**Familiarity with Docker**](/freecodecamp.org/how-docker-containers-work.md): Strix runs its tests in isolated Docker containers. A basic understanding of images and containers will help you follow what’s happening under the hood.
- **An AI provider key:** Strix uses an LLM to reason about vulnerabilities. You’ll need an API key from a supported provider such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or others that’s compatible with Strix.

:::

Having these ready will make it easier to move straight into installation and hands-on testing with Strix.

## The Problem Developers Face

Modern development moves fast. Frameworks change, dependencies grow, and release cycles shrink.

But while new features are pushed every week, security testing often stays slow and disconnected from the coding process.

You might use a scanner that says, “Possible IDOR vulnerability detected.” That word “possible” means hours of checking, reproducing, and sometimes discovering the issue was not real.

Developers don’t need guesses. They need proof. Strix gives you that proof.

---

## The Strix Approach

Strix is not a scanner. It’s a set of autonomous AI agents that behave like hackers. They explore, test, exploit, and confirm.

![Strix interface](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759984071844/c1acc193-8916-412f-aa84-19593a77001a.png)

Each agent focuses on a different layer of security. Together, they form a complete system that can scan code, attack endpoints, and verify exploits.

When Strix finds something, it doesn’t give you a vague report. It shows you exactly what happened, where it happened, and how to fix it.

It is like having a tireless security team inside your development workflow, ready to test every push and pull request.

---

## How to Install Strix

Make sure you have [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-docker"/>Docker](https://docker.com/) running, Python 3.12 or newer, and an LLM provider key ready.

Then install the Strix CLI with pipx:

```sh
pipx install strix-agent
```

Configure your AI provider by exporting the model and API key. For example, with OpenAI:

```sh
export STRIX_LLM="openai/gpt-5"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

---

## Working with Strix

Running Strix is simple. You point it at your app, and it takes over the rest.

```sh
strix --target ./app
```

When you launch it, Strix creates a sandbox inside Docker. Everything runs in isolation so nothing dangerous escapes.

Inside the sandbox, multiple AI agents start working together. They scan your routes, send HTTP requests, inject payloads, and interpret responses.

If a vulnerability looks real, Strix goes a step further. It creates a working exploit, runs it safely, and confirms whether the attack actually works.

The output is saved locally in a folder with detailed logs, proofs of concept, and recommended fixes.

This approach means you never waste time chasing false positives. Every result is real, tested, and reproducible.

Let’s look at a couple examples to see Strix in action.

---

## Example: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Imagine an API that returns user invoices by ID.

```plaintext
GET /invoices/123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The endpoint looks up the invoice by numeric ID and returns the record without verifying the requester owns it.

When you run Strix, the recon agent maps the route and the auth agent examines the token behavior. The agents automatically try accessing neighbouring IDs and reuse tokens from other test accounts.

Strix sends a request like `GET /invoices/124` using a token from user A and observes the response. If the API returns an invoice that belongs to user B, Strix confirms an IDOR.

The report includes the exact request that succeeded, the affected resource IDs, and a recommended fix such as enforcing server side ownership checks and mapping IDs to user scope rather than accepting raw numeric identifiers.

---

## Example: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Unsafe Deserialization

Consider a microservice that accepts serialized job payloads for background processing.

```py
@app.post("/jobs")
def create_job(payload: bytes):
    job = pickle.loads(payload)
    job.run()
    return {"status": "queued"}
```

If the service blindly deserializes and executes objects from untrusted input, an attacker can send a crafted object that runs code on the server.

Strix runs the service inside a safe Docker sandbox and the agents build a harmless test payload. When deserialized, it triggers an action inside that sandbox.

If the service executes the object, Strix records the result and saves the serialized proof of concept and the output it produced. The report shows the payload and the output so you can see the problem for yourself.

The best way to fix this is to avoid loading untrusted data with unsafe methods. Use safe data formats like JSON and check the input before using it. If you must load serialized data, make sure it runs with very limited permissions so even if something bad happens, it cannot harm the system.

---

## How Strix Thinks

Behind the scenes, Strix uses something called a coordination graph. It’s a network of AI agents that share data and tasks.

One agent might map endpoints, another might generate payloads, while a third documents successful exploits.

This collaboration makes Strix efficient and adaptable. The agents can divide large tasks across different areas of your application, sharing findings and improving accuracy as they go.

It feels less like a single tool and more like a small team of specialized hackers that understand your app’s structure.

Strix was designed to fit naturally into a developer’s workflow. It runs through a simple command line interface.

The reports are stored in plain files you can open in any editor. There are no complex dashboards to learn or heavy agents to install.

You can scan a local project directory, a GitHub repository, or a live web app. You can even give Strix specific instructions. For example, you can say, “Focus on authentication and privilege escalation,” and the AI will prioritize those areas.

The results appear in a folder under `agent_runs`. Each report includes clear descriptions, confirmed exploits, and step-by-step remediation advice. You can push these results into your issue tracker or CI pipeline directly.

You can run Strix locally for free. All processing happens inside your Docker environment. No code or sensitive data leaves your machine.

If you prefer not to deal with setup, you can use the hosted version at [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>usestrix.com](https://usestrix.com/). The cloud platform runs the same engine but offers more performance, managed storage, and integrations for larger teams.

---

## Enterprise Platform

For organizations that manage many applications, Strix offers an enterprise edition. It expands the open-source version into a full security platform for teams.

![Strix Enterprise](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759984117051/93acc5e5-7bee-4a0a-bfe1-628508e41e5a.png)

The enterprise option adds dashboards that visualize vulnerabilities across all projects in one view. It supports large-scale parallel scanning, CI/CD integration, and third-party connections like Jira and Slack. Companies can even use custom fine-tuned AI models trained on their own security data.

This makes it possible for security engineers and developers to collaborate in real time. Developers can trigger scans from their pipelines, while security teams can monitor progress, assign tasks, and review trends from a single interface. It turns Strix into a continuous security layer across the entire software lifecycle.

---

## Why Strix Matters

Developers want to write secure code, but security has always been a specialized field. Strix bridges that gap. It brings real hacking techniques into your everyday workflow and gives you proof instead of theory.

Instead of waiting for a pentest weeks later, you can know within minutes if your latest code introduced a vulnerability. You get clear, verified results with practical fixes. That saves time, reduces stress, and builds confidence in your codebase.

---

## The Future of AI Security

Strix represents a new kind of security automation. It is not a static scanner or a chatbot. It is an intelligent system that plans, acts, and learns.

As AI models improve, tools like Strix will evolve into even more capable digital testers that can understand complex systems and adapt their attacks accordingly.

This is where security testing is heading. Developers will not have to rely on slow manual audits or external reports. They will have automated AI teams testing their code continuously, just like automated tests and linters do today.

---

## Conclusion

Strix turns AI into your personal ethical hacker. It scans your applications, finds real vulnerabilities, confirms them through safe exploitation, and tells you how to fix them. It works locally, in CI, or in the cloud, and scales up for enterprise teams that need deep visibility across large systems.

For developers, Strix means faster feedback, stronger code, and fewer surprises in production. It brings security into the same loop as development, testing, and deployment.
