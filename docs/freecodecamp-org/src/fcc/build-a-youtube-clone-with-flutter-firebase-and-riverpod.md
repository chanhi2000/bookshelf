We just released a new course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a full stack application. This beginner-friendly course will guide you through the process of creating a fully functional YouTube clone app, utilizing some of the latest technologies in mobile app development.

Here are the key technologies used in this course:
