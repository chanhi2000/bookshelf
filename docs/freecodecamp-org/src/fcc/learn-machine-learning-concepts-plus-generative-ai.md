Machine learning is revolutionizing industries by enabling computers to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions without explicit programming. If you've ever been curious about how AI systems work, this course provides a structured introduction to the field—covering everything from the basics of machine learning to the cutting-edge innovations in Generative AI.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will introduce you to the fundamentals of machine learning and Generative AI. The course starts by explaining what machine learning is, how it differs from traditional programming, and its real-world applications. You’ll then explore machine learning models, algorithms, and the training process to understand what happens "under the hood." The course also includes a hands-on comparison of machine learning versus traditional software development.

Rola Dali created this course. Rola is an AI Engineer and has a PHD in NeuroScience.

One of the most exciting aspects of this course is its introduction to Generative AI, which is the technology behind tools like ChatGPT, DALL·E, and other AI content generators. You’ll learn how these models work, how they generate new content, and how they are architected for deployment in real-world applications.

Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll learn:

- **Machine Learning Basics** - Understand key concepts, including the difference between ML and traditional programming.
- **How ML Works** - Learn about different types of ML models, training methods, and real-world use cases.
- **ML vs. Traditional Software** - See a practical demonstration of how ML-based systems differ from traditional rule-based software.
- **Introduction to Generative AI** - Discover how AI models like ChatGPT generate text, images, and more.
- **Architecting GenAI Systems** - Gain insights into building and deploying AI-powered applications.

This course is designed for beginners and is a perfect starting point if you want to dive into AI and machine learning. Whether you’re an aspiring data scientist, a developer looking to expand your skill set, or simply curious about AI, this course will provide valuable insights.

Check out the full course now on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/tmB5JIX3Lxk) (2-hour watch).
