Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming industries, and AI Engineers are at the forefront of this revolution. If you’re looking to break into AI Engineering or advance your skills, having a clear roadmap is essential.

Mastering AI requires a blend of mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, and hands-on engineering experience to build and deploy intelligent systems effectively.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that provides a **comprehensive AI Engineering roadmap**, guiding you through the essential skills and techniques you need to master by 2025. Developed by Tatev Aslanyan from LunarTech, this course covers everything from fundamental mathematics and key machine learning algorithms to large language models, AI best practices, and industry applications. Alongside hands-on implementation in Python, this roadmap also offers invaluable career insights to help you succeed in the evolving AI landscape.
