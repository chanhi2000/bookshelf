[<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-sqlite"/>SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) is one of the most underappreciated tools in a developer's toolkit. It's a full-featured relational database that runs directly in your application. No server setup. No configuration files. No network protocols. Just a simple library that gives you the power of an ACID compliant RDBMS right where you need it.

SQLite powers more applications than you might think. It's in every smartphone, most web browsers, and countless desktop applications. Your phone probably has hundreds of SQLite databases on it right now. Despite handling billions of databases worldwide, many developers aren't familiar with all of the cool things that you can do with SQLite.

This tutorial introduces SQLite through practical examples in C/C++, Python, and Java. You can pick and choose the languages that suit your needs. No language wars here. You'll learn how to integrate SQLite into real applications. Whether you're building a desktop app, a web API, or just need local data storage without the drama of a full database server, SQLite has your back.

## Code Playbacks

Code playbacks are a unique way to learn about programming. They are guided walkthroughs of code, allowing you to see not just the code itself but also the thought process behind it. This approach helps you understand not only what the code does, but why it was written that way. Here is a short video to show how to move through a code playback:

<VidStack src="youtube/uYbHqCNjVDM" />

By registering on [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Playback Press](https://playbackpress.com/books), you'll gain access to an AI assistant that can answer your questions about the code. This makes learning even more interactive and personalized. Watch this video to see how to work with it:

## A Brief Introduction to SQLite

You can find my entire collection of SQLite code playbacks in my free book, [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>"Programming with SQLite"](https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook).

Here's what you'll learn:

### Chapter 1: Database Design and SQL

In this chapter, I cover the basics of relational database design and SQL. I keep it simple and practical. If you'd like more introductory SQL content like this go to my [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Intro SQL](https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlbook) book. If you'd like some SQL problems to work through, check out [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>30 Worked SQL Examples](https://playbackpress.com/books/workedsqlbook). If you already dream in `SELECT` statements, skip ahead to the chapter that best suits your needs.

}
```

```component VPCard

  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

### Chapter 2: SQLite in C/C++

In this chapter, I discuss how to use the low level SQLite API from a C or C++ program. You have a lot of power when using the API and I cover ACID transactions. Yes, we're going to talk about pointers and memory management. Even if you're not a C/C++ programmer and haven't touched a pointer since college, I recommend looking at this chapter. Understanding what's happening under the hood will make the other chapters clearer. Plus, you can impress your friends at parties by casually mentioning you know how database transactions really work.

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "2.1 Using the SQLite C/C++ API",
  "desc": "Programming with SQLite by Mark Mahoney",
  "link": "https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook/chapter/2/1",
  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "2.2 An Object Oriented Auction Program",
  "desc": "Programming with SQLite by Mark Mahoney",
  "link": "https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook/chapter/2/2",
  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "2.3 SQLite Transactions",
  "desc": "Programming with SQLite by Mark Mahoney",
  "link": "https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook/chapter/2/3",
  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

### Chapter 3: SQLite in Python

Learn how to use SQLite in any Python program including Flask web apps. No ORMs hiding what's really happening. Just clean, direct database access. I cover how to query and create SQLite databases and then show how to build an API using [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/). By the end, you'll have a working web API that didn't require installing PostgreSQL, configuring connection pools, or sacrificing a weekend to database administration.

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "3.1 Using a SQLite Database in a Python Program",
  "desc": "Programming with SQLite by Mark Mahoney",
  "link": "https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook/chapter/3/1",
  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "3.2 Creating SQLite Databases",
  "desc": "Programming with SQLite by Mark Mahoney",
  "link": "https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook/chapter/3/2",
  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "3.3 Using SQLite in a Flask Web Application",
  "desc": "Programming with SQLite by Mark Mahoney",
  "link": "https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook/chapter/3/3",
  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

```component VPCard

  "title": "3.4 Creating a Web API with Flask and SQLite",

  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```

### Chapter 4: SQLite in Java

In this final chapter I give an example in Java using JDBC. Because sometimes you need to write enterprise code, and SQLite works there too. Who says you need Oracle for everything?

```component VPCard
{
  "title": "4.1 Using a SQLite Database in a Java Program",
  "desc": "Programming with SQLite by Mark Mahoney",
  "link": "https://playbackpress.com/books/sqlitebook/chapter/4/1",
  "logo": "https://playbackpress.com/favicon.ico",
  "background": "rgba(59,76,98,0.2)"
}
```
