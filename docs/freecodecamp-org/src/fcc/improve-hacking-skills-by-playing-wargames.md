Hacking is a skill that fascinates many people. You’ve seen hackers in movies. They type at keyboards, breaking into high-security systems in seconds.

But real hacking isn’t quite like that. It takes patience, creativity, and most importantly, a lot of practice.

One of the best ways to sharpen your hacking skills is by playing wargames. They are interactive hacking challenges that push your problem-solving abilities. Of the many online wargames, [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) is the best. It is fun, educational, and accessible for both beginners and expert hackers.

In this article, we’ll explore why OverTheWire is such a fantastic resource. Whether you’re new to hacking or want to test your skills, OverTheWire will have something for you.

## What are Wargames?

In cybersecurity, wargames are exercises. They simulate attacking and defending computer systems. These games often mimic real-life scenarios. They help you improve your skills without real-world risks.

Wargames can take different forms. Capture the Flag (CTF) is a common type. Players solve challenges to find hidden “flags” in the system. In attack-defense games, teams protect their systems while trying to compromise the opponent’s. In incident response wargames, defenders react to a simulated cyberattack and work to recover.

Wargames give you hands-on experience in cybersecurity. They teach you how to solve problems, think critically, and handle pressure while working in teams. These exercises are valuable for building real-world skills.

## What is OverTheWire?

OverTheWire is an online platform that offers a collection of wargames. These wargames teach you the basics of cybersecurity through hands-on challenges.

The site hosts several different games, each focusing on different aspects of hacking. You will encounter everything from basic Linux commands to more advanced topics.

OverTheWire wargames are progressive. This means that they start out easy and gradually get harder as you advance through the levels.

If you’re just starting out, this makes the learning curve manageable. But don’t worry, the more complex challenges will give even seasoned hackers something to chew on.

OverTheWire doesn’t just stick to one type of challenge. As you progress through different games, you’ll encounter a wide array of topics. These include Linux fundamentals, networking, file manipulation, scripting, and many others.

Some games, like Narnia, exploit buffer overflows. Others, like Krypton, dive into cryptography. This variety ensures you get a well-rounded education in different aspects of cybersecurity.

OverTheWire has a large, [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>active community](https://overthewire.org/information/chat.html). While the wargames encourage you to solve problems on your own, there is no shortage of help when you need it.

The official forums are great for asking questions and sharing insights. You can also discuss tricky levels with other players.

While the community can help, solving the challenges yourself is the best way to learn. Looking up answers too early can take away from the experience.

## Wargames You Should Try

Let’s take a quick look at some of the key wargames on OverTheWire that you can start playing today.

::: tabs

@tab:active Bandit

[Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is the entry point for most people. Bandit teaches you basic Linux commands, file manipulation, and navigation. It’s a perfect place to start if you’ve never used the terminal before or if you want to brush up on fundamental skills.

For example, in one of the early Bandit levels, you are given a password hidden inside a text file. The challenge is finding the file, reading its contents, and then using that information to advance to the next level.

@tab Leviathan

[**Leviathan**](https://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) is more advanced. It teaches you about binary analysis and how to find vulnerabilities in programs. Players solve puzzles that require reverse engineering, debugging, and exploiting weaknesses. It’s a great way to practice finding and fixing security flaws in software.

@tab Narnia

[**Narnia**](https://overthewire.org/wargames/narnia/)

If you want to learn about buffer overflows and binary exploitation, Narnia will teach you both. It starts with simple vulnerabilities and gradually increases in difficulty. You’ll learn how to exploit code to gain control over programs and escalate privileges.
