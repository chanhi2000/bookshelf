Prepare for the Google Generative AI Leader exam and pass!

A Generative AI Leader is a visionary developer with comprehensive knowledge of how generative AI (gen AI) can transform businesses. They have business-level knowledge of Google Cloud's gen AI offerings and understand how Google's AI-first approach can lead organizations toward innovative and responsible AI adoption.

Gen AI Leaders also influence gen AI-powered initiatives and identify opportunities across business functions and industries, using Google Cloud's enterprise-ready offerings to accelerate innovation.

We just posted a new course of the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you prepare for the Google Gen AI exam. Andrew Brown from ExamPro developed this course.

Here are the sections in this course:

- Introduction
- Core General AI Concepts
- Security
- Vertex Search
- Model
- Engagement Suite
- Google Agentspace
- Gemini with Google Workspace
- Vertex AI Studio
- Agent Builder
