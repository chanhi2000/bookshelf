Create the <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-html5"/>`index.html` file for the landing page layout:

```sh
touch index.html
```

Initialize the project with `npm`:

```sh
npm init -y
```

This will create a <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-json"/>`package.json` file for the project.

#### 2. Add Bootstrap 5 to the project:

You can include Bootstrap 5 in two ways: by downloading the compiled CSS and JS files or by using a CDN. For simplicity, we’ll use the CDN links.

In the `<head>` section of your <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-html5"/>`index.html`, add:

```html
<link href="<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css>" rel="stylesheet">
```

At the end of the `<body>` section, add:

```html
<script src="<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js>"></script>
```

This ensures that Bootstrap 5 is integrated into the project for layout and component styling.

#### 3. Basic Structure of the Landing Page:

Start by setting up the basic layout in your <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-html5"/>`index.html` file:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Landing Page</title>
  <!-- Bootstrap 5 CDN -->
  <link href="<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css>" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Landing Page Content -->
  <script src="<https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js>"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This simple structure sets the stage for a responsive design. Feel free to modify the content as per your requirements.

The Footer section is often the last thing users see on a page, so it’s essential to include important links, contact details, and legal information. A well-designed footer can help improve site navigation and encourage further engagement with your content.

```md title="Prompt Example"
Design a Footer section that includes key navigation links, such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and social media icons (for example, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). Include your company’s contact details (email, phone) and a copyright notice. The footer should be responsive and neatly organized.
```

**Customizing the Style:**

To match your brand’s aesthetics, you can adjust the Footer section’s background color, typography, and icon styles. You can also add additional links like your blog, careers page, or a newsletter signup form. Ensure the footer is responsive by checking it on different screen sizes, making adjustments to spacing or layout as needed.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we’ve demonstrated how to create a modern, responsive landing page using Bootstrap 5 and integrate Context7 MCP. We also explored different methods for building the landing page, either using a single comprehensive prompt or constructing it section by section.

While a single comprehensive prompt can generate a landing page quickly, building it section by section typically yields better results. This approach allows for greater customization, finer control over each element, and ensures that every section aligns with your overall design vision.

By leveraging Bootstrap 5’s robust grid system and Context7’s AI-driven component generation, you can easily create landing pages that are not only visually appealing but also responsive and functional across all devices. This combination of tools makes the process faster, more efficient, and scalable.

You can also consider using a ready made [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>bootstrap template](https://themeselection.com/item/category/bootstrap-templates/) which comes with pre designed landing pages.

Rather than requiring developers to manually write repetitive code for common components, such as navigation bars, feature cards, or grids, VS Code and Context7 automates this process, allowing you to focus on higher-level design decisions.

It also ensures that the generated code is fully responsive and in alignment with latest Bootstrap 5’s framework, providing seamless integration with Bootstrap’s utilities like spacing, alignment, and visibility.
