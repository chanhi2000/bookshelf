Here are a few things you should know before we dive into the specifics of the language.

First, [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-golang"/>go.dev](https://go.dev/) is the homepage of the language. This will be your go-to resource to:

- Download the Go binaries (the `go` command and other related tools) from [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-golang"/>go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Reference the official Go documentation [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-golang"/>go.dev/doc/](https://go.dev/doc/)
- See all the the Go packages [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-golang"/>pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/)
- Access the Go Playground [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-golang"/>go.dev/play/](https://go.dev/play/)

…and more.
