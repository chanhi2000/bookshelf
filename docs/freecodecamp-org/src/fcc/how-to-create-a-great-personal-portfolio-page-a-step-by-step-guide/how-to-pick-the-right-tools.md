Choosing the right tools to build your portfolio involves understanding your needs, evaluating available options, and selecting solutions that align with your skills and goals.

This chapter guides you through this process, from deciding between coding your own site vs using a no-code platform to selecting the perfect hosting provider.

## Understand Your Needs

First, it's important to identify your field: are you in the tech industry, or are you in some other line of work?

Your field of work significantly influences your choice of portfolio tools. Tech professionals might lean towards custom-coded sites to showcase their coding prowess, while those in non-tech fields may prefer no-code builders for their convenience and ease of use.

Next, you'll want to evaluate your skills to decide how to actually create the site. Do you want to code your own portfolio, or choose a no-code solution?

Assess your skills honestly. If you're comfortable with coding, a custom-built site might be the best way to showcase your technical abilities. For those without coding skills or a desire to learn, no-code platforms offer a practical and efficient alternative.

Then you'll want to set your website goals and objectives. Define what you want your portfolio to achieve. Are you looking to attract freelance clients, land a full-time job, or simply showcase your work? Your goals can influence the choice of platform, design, and content of your portfolio.
