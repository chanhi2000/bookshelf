n8n is an open-source, visual workflow automation tool that lets you connect applications, APIs, and AI models to build complex, intelligent automations.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will be your guide to mastering n8n. This beginner-level training covers integrating APIs, automating processes, and orchestrating intelligent agents. The goal is to provide a future-proof skillset, essential for roles in DevOps, AI, and data engineering. Marconi Darmawan from KodeKloud developed this course.

You will build practical AI agents, including an Email AI Agent and Research Workflows using services like OpenAI. A key focus is on intelligent systems, where you will set up a vector database (Pinecone) to build a Customer Support RAG Agent using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

For advanced skill development, the course covers scalable design and deployment. You will learn Modular Component Patterns (MCPs) and practice Multi-Workflow Advanced Builds to coordinate complex tasks with a "team of agents." And you'll explore flexible hosting options, including cloud, Docker, and self-hosting with local LLMs like Ollama.

Here are the projects you will build:

- Build an Email AI Agent to automate communications
- Design a Research Workflow with Perplexity & OpenAI
- Create a Customer Support RAG Agent using vector databases
- Develop Slack and multimedia AI agents (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video)
- Replace manual processes with a team of agents through multi-workflow builds

Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/UIf-SlmMays) (4-hour watch).
