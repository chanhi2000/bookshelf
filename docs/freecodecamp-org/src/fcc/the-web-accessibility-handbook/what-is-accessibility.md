Accessibility (A11y) is an important practice in web development that aims to make the website usable (accessible) for all people. This includes people who have disabilities that make it difficult for them to use websites. By making a website accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities, we ensure that they have the same opportunities as we do. We’re also helping to make the web a more inclusive place overall.

What kind of disabilities should we consider? In broad terms:

- Visual impairments: blindness, blurred vision, and colour blindness
- Hearing impairments: low to no hearing
- Mobility Impairments: difficulty with physical movement(s)
- Cognitive Impairments: like Dyslexia and ADHD

People with visual impairments commonly use devices like [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>screen readers](https://axesslab.com/what-is-a-screen-reader/) to visualise and understand a website’s content, for example. So a big part of web accessibility is designing a website that can be easily accessed by a screen reader.

There are various practices that you, as a developer, can follow to make a website accessible, which I’ll cover in this handbook.
