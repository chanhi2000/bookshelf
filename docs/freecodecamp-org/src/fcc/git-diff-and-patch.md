Many of the interesting processes in Git like merging, rebasing, or even committing are based on diffs and patches.

Developers work with diffs all the time, whether using Git directly or relying on the IDE's diff view. In this post, you will learn what Git diffs and patches are, their structure, and how to apply patches.

In [**a previous post**](/freecodecamp.org/git-internals-objects-branches-create-repo/README.md), you learned about Git‚Äôs objects. Specifically, we discussed that a commit is a snapshot of the working tree at a certain point in time, in addition to some meta-data.

Yet, it is really hard to make sense of individual commits by looking at the entire working tree. Rather, it is more helpful to look at how different a commit is from its parent commit, that is, the **diff** between these commits.

So, what do I mean when I say `diff`? Let‚Äôs start with some history.

---

## Git Diff's History üìñ

Git‚Äôs `diff` is based on the diff utility on UNIX systems. `diff` was developed in the early 1970s on the Unix operating system. The first released version shipped with the 5th Edition of Unix in 1974. `git diff` is a command that takes two inputs, and computes the difference between them. Inputs can be commits, but also files, and even files that have never been introduced to the repository.

![Git diff takes two inputs, which can be commits or files<br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>)](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-214.png)

<VidStack src="youtube/eG9oAroMcPk" />

This is important - `git diff` computes the difference between two strings, which most of the time happen to consist of code, but not necessarily.

---

## Time to Get Hands-On üôåüèª

You are encouraged to run the commands yourself while reading this post.

Consider this very short text file, called <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt` on my machine, which consists of 6 lines:

![<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt` consists of 6 lines<br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-158.png)

Now, modify this file a bit. Remove the second line, and insert a new line as the fourth line. Add an `!` to the end of the last line, so you get this result:

![After modifying <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt`, we get different 6 lines<br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-159.png)

Save this file with a new name, say <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt`.

Now we can run `git diff` to compute the difference between the files like so:

```sh
git diff --no-index file.txt new_file.txt
```

::: note 

I will explain the `--no-index` switch of this command later.

:::

![The output of `git diff`<br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-160.png)

So the output of `git diff` shows quite a lot of things.

For now, focus on the part starting with `This is a simple line`. You can see that the added line (`// new test`) is preceded by a `+` sign. The deleted line is preceded by a `-` sign.

Interestingly, notice that Git views a modified line as a sequence of two changes - erasing a line and adding a new line instead. So the patch includes deleting the last line, and adding a new line that equals to that line, with the addition of a `!`.

![Addition lines are preceded by `+`, deletion lines by `-`, and modification lines are sequences of deletions and additions<br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-165.png)

The terms `patch` and `diff` are often used interchangeably, although there is a distinction, at least historically.

A `diff` shows the differences between two files, or snapshots, and can be quite minimal in doing so. A `patch` is an extension of a `diff`, augmented with further information such as context lines and filenames, which allow it to be applied more widely. It is a text document that describes how to alter an existing file or codebase.

These days, the Unix diff program, and `git diff`, can produce patches of various kinds.

A `patch` is a compact representation of the differences between two files. It describes how to turn one file into another.

That is, if you apply the ‚Äúinstructions‚Äù produced by `git diff` on <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt` - that is, remove the second line, insert `// new text` as the fourth line, and add another `!` to the last line - you would get the content of <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt`.

Another important thing to note is that a patch is asymmetric: the patch from <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt` to <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` is not the same as the patch for the other direction.

So, in this example, generating a `patch` between <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` and <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt`, in this order, would mean exactly the opposite instructions than before - add the second line instead of removing it, and so on.

![A `patch` consists of asymmetric instructions to get from one file to another <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-167.png)

Try it out:

```sh
git diff --no-index new_file.txt file.txt
```

![Running `git diff` in the reverse direction yields the reverse instructions - add a line instead of removing it, and so on <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-169.png)

The `patch` format uses context, as well as line numbers, to locate differing file regions. This allows a `patch` to be applied to a somewhat earlier or later version of the first file than the one from which it was derived, as long as the applying program can still locate the context of the change.

---

## The Structure of a Diff üîç

So, it's time to dive deeper üòé.

Generate a diff from <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt` to <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` again, and consider the output more carefully:

```sh
git diff --no-index file.txt new_file.txt
```

The first line introduces the compared files. Git always gives one file the name `a`, and the other the name `b`. So in this case <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt` is called `a`, whereas <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` is called `b`.

![The first line in `diff` 's output introduces the files being compared <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-170.png)

Then the second line, starting with `index`, includes the blob SHAs of these files. So even though in our case they are not even stored within a Git repo, Git shows their corresponding SHA-1 values.

If you need a reminder about blobs in particular and Git objects in general, check out [**this post**](/freecodecamp.org/git-internals-objects-branches-create-repo/README.md).

The third value in this line, `100644`, is the "mode bits", indicating that this is a "regular" file: not executable and not a symbolic link.

The use of two dots (`..`) here between the blob SHAs is just as a separator (unlike other cases where it is used within Git).

Other header lines might indicate the old and new mode bits if they changed, old and new filenames if the file were being renamed, and so on.

![The second line in `diff` 's output includes the blob SHAs of the compared files, as well as the mode bits <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-171.png)

The blob SHAs (also called "blob IDs") are helpful if this patch is later applied by Git to the same project and there are conflicts while applying it.

After the blob IDs, we have two lines: one starting with `-` signs, and the other starting with `+` signs. This is the traditional "unified diff" header, again showing the files being compared and the direction of the changes: `-` signs show lines in the A version but missing from the B version, and `+` signs, lines missing in A version but present in B.

If the patch were of this file being added or deleted in its entirety, then one of these would be <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`/dev/null` to signal that.

![`-` signs show lines in the A version but missing from the B version; and `+` signs, lines missing in A version but present in B <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-172.png)

Consider the case where we delete a file: `rm file.txt`

And then we use `git diff`:

![`diff`'s output for a deleted file <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-173.png)

The A version, representing the state of the index, is currently <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`file.txt`, compared to the working dir where this file does not exist, so it is <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`/dev/null`. All lines are preceded by `-` signs as they exist only in the A version.

Going back to the previous diff:

![`diff`'s output includes changes sections called "hunks" or "chunks" <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-174.png)

After this unified diff header, we get to the main part of the diff, consisting of "difference sections", also called "hunks" or "chunks" in Git.

Note that these terms are used interchangeably, and you may stumble upon either of them in Git's documentation and tutorials, as well as Git's source code.

Every hunk begins with a single line, starting with two `@` signs. These signs are followed by at most four numbers, and then a header for the chunk - which is an educated guess by Git which sometimes works well.

Usually, it will include the beginning of a function or a class, when possible. In this example it doesn't include anything as this is a text file, so consider another example for a moment:

```sh
git diff --no-index example.py example_changed.py
```

![When possible, Git includes a header for each hunk, for example a function or class definition <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-175.png)

In the image above the hunk's header includes the beginning of the function that includes the changed lines - `def example_function(x)`.

Back to our previous example then:

![Back to the previous `diff` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-174.png)

After the two `@` signs, you can find four numbers.

The first numbers are preceded by a `-` sign as they refer to `file A`. The first number represents the line number corresponding to the first line in `file A` this hunk refers to. In the example above, it is `1`, meaning that the line `This is a simple file` corresponds to line number `1` in version `file A`.

This number is followed by a comma (`,`), and then the number of lines this chunk consists of in `file A`. This number includes all context lines (the lines preceded with a space in the diff), or lines marked with a `-` sign, as they are part of `file A`, but not lines marked with a `+` sign, as they do not exist in `file A`.

In the example above this number is `6`, counting the context line `This is a simple file`, the `-` line `It has a nice poem:`, then the three context lines, and lastly `Are belong to you`.

As you can see, the lines beginning with a space character are context lines, which means they appear as shown in both `file A` and `file B`.

Then, we have a `+` sign to mark the two numbers that refer to `file B`. First, the line number corresponding to the first line in `file B`, followed by the number of lines this chunk consists of - in `file B`.

This number includes all context lines, as well as lines marked with the `+` sign, as they are part of `file B`, but not lines marked with a `-` sign.

After the header of the chunk, we get the actual lines - either context, `-` or `+` lines.

Typically and by default, a hunk starts and ends with three context lines, in case there are of course three lines before and after the modified lines in the source file.

## How to Produce diffs ‚å®Ô∏è

The example above shows a diff between the two files exactly. A single patch file can contain the differences for any number of files, and `git diff` produces diffs for all altered files in the repository in a single patch.

Often, you will see the output of `git diff` showing two versions of the *same* file and the difference between them.

To demonstrate, consider this other repository:

```sh
cd ~/brief-example
```

At the current state, the active directory is a Git repository, with a clean status:

```sh
git status
```

![In another repository with a clean status <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-177.png)

Take an existing file, like this one:

![An example file - <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`my_file.py` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-178.png)

And change one of its lines. For example, consider the second line:

![The contents of <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`my_file.py` after modifying the second line <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-179.png)

And run `git diff`:

![The output of `git diff` for <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`my_file.py` after changing it <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-180.png)

The output of `git diff` shows the difference between <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`my_file.py`'s version in the staging area, which in this case is the same as the last commit (`HEAD`), and in the working directory.

I covered the terms "working directory", "staging area", and "commit" in [**a previous post**](/freecodecamp.org/git-internals-objects-branches-create-repo/README.md), so check it out in case you missed it or would like to refresh your memory.

As [**a reminder**](/freecodecamp.org/git-internals-objects-branches-create-repo/README.md), the terms "staging area" and "index" are interchangeable, and both are widely used.

![At this state, the status of the working dir is the same as the status of the index and that of `HEAD`. <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-182.png)

So to see the difference between the working dir and the staging area, use `git diff`, without any additional flags.

![Without switches, `git diff` shows the difference between the staging area <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-181.png)

As you can see, `git diff` lists here both `file A` and `file B` pointing to <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`my_file.py`. So `file A` here refers to the version of <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`my_file.py` in the staging area, whereas `file B` refers to its version in the working dir.

Note that if you modify <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-python"/>`my_file.py` in a text editor, and don‚Äôt save the file, then `git diff` will not be aware of the changes you've made, as they haven‚Äôt been saved to the working dir.

There are a few switches we can provide to `git diff` to get the diff between the working dir and a specific commit, or between the staging area and the latest commit, or between two commits and so on.

First create a new file, <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt`, and save it. Currently the file is in the working dir, and it is actually untracked in Git.

![A simple new file saved as <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-183.png)

Now stage and commit this file:

```sh
git add new_file.txt` `git commit -m "new file!"
```

Now, the state of `HEAD` is the same as the state of the staging area, as well as the working tree:

![The state of `HEAD` is the same as the index and the working dir <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-184.png)

Next, edit <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt`, by adding a new line at the beginning and another new line at the end:

![Modifying <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` by adding a line in the beginning and another in the end <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-185.png)

As a result, the state is as follows:

![After saving, the state in the working dir is different than that of the index or `HEAD` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-186.png)

A nice trick would be to use `git add -p`, which allows you you split the changes even within a file, and consider which ones you'd like to stage.

So in this case, add the first line to the index, but not the last line. To do that, you can split the hunk using `s`, then accept to stage the first hunk (using `y`), and not the second part (using `n`).

If you are not sure what each letter stands for, you can always use a `?` and Git will tell you.

![Using `git add -p`, you can stage only the first change <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-187.png)

So now the state in `HEAD` is without either of those new lines. In the staging area we have the first line but not the last line, and in the working dir we have both new lines.

![The state after staging only the first line <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-189.png)

If you use `git diff`, what will happen?

![`git diff` shows the difference between the index and the working dir <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-188.png)

Well, as stated before, you get the diff between the staging area and the working tree.

What happens if you want to get the diff between `HEAD` and the staging area? For that, you can use `git diff -cached`:

![`git diff --cached` shows the difference between `HEAD` and the index <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-190.png)

And what if we want the difference between `HEAD` and the working tree? For that we can run `git diff HEAD`:

![`git diff HEAD` shows the difference between `HEAD` and the working dir <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-191.png)

To summarize the different switches for `git diff`, see this diagram that you can go back to as a reference when needed:

![Different switches for `git diff` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-192.png)

As a reminder, at the beginning of this post you used `git diff --no-index`. With the `--no-index` switch you can compare two files that are not part of the repository - or of any staging area.

Now, commit the changes you have in the staging area:

```sh
git commit -m "added a first line"
```

To observe the diff between this commit, and its parent commit, you can run the following command:

```sh
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
```

![The output of `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-194.png)

By the way, we can omit the `1` above and write `HEAD~`, and get the same result. Using `1` is the explicit way to state you are referring to the first parent of the commit.

Note that writing the parent commit here, `HEAD~1`, first results in a diff showing how to get from the parent commit to the current commit. Of course, I could also generate the reverse diff by writing:

```sh
git diff HEAD HEAD~1
```

![The output of `git diff HEAD HEAD~1` generates the reverse patch <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-195.png)

![The different switches for `git diff` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-196.png)

A short way to view the diff between a commit and its parent, is by using `git show`, for example:

```sh
git show HEAD
```

This is the same as writing:

```sh
git diff HEAD~ HEAD
```

We can now update our diagram:

As [**a reminder**](/freecodecamp.org/git-internals-objects-branches-create-repo/README.md), Git commits are snapshots - of the entire working directory of the repository, at a certain point in time. Yet, it is sometimes not very useful to regard a commit as a whole snapshot, but rather by the changes this specific commit introduced. In other words, by the **diff** between a parent commit to the next commit.

It is still important to remember that Git stores the entire snapshots, and the diff is dynamically generated from the snapshot data - by comparing the root trees of the commit and its parent.

Of course, Git can compare any two snapshots in time, not just adjacent commits, and also generate a diff of files not included in a repository.

## How to Apply Patches üí™üèª

By using `git diff` you can see the patch, and you can then apply this patch using `git apply`.

### Historical note üìî

Actually, sharing patches used to be the main way to share code in the early days of open source. But now - virtually all projects have moved to sharing Git commits directly through pull requests (called "merge requests" on some platforms).

The biggest problem with using patches is that it is hard to apply a patch when your working directory does not match the sender's previous commit.

Losing the commit history makes it difficult to resolve conflicts. You will better understand it as you dive deeper into the process of `git apply`.

### A simple apply

What does it mean to apply a patch? It's time to try it out!

Take the output of `git diff`:

```sh
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
```

And store it in a file:

```sh
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD > my_patch.patch
```

And `reset` to undo the last commit:

```sh
git reset -hard HEAD~1
```

If you are not completely comfortable with `git reset`, check [**a previous post that covered it in depth**](/freecodecamp.org/save-the-day-with-git-reset.md). In short, it allows us to "reset" the state of where `HEAD` is pointing to, as well as the state of the index and of the working dir.

In the example above, they are all set to the state of `HEAD~1`, or `Commit 3` in the diagram.

So after running the reset command, the contents of the file are as follows:

```sh

And we will apply this patch:

```sh
nano my_patch.patch
```

This patch tells git to find the lines:

```txt
This is a new file
With new content!
```

That used to be lines `1` and `2`, and add a line `START` right above them.

Run this command to apply the patch:

```sh
git apply my_patch.patch
```

And as a result, you get this version of your file, just like the commit you have created before:

```sh
nano new_file.txt
```

## Understanding the Context Lines üßëüèª‚Äçüè´

To understand the importance of context lines, consider a more advanced scenario. What happens if line numbers have changed since you created the patch file? ü§î

To test, start by creating another file:

![Creating another file - <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`another_file.txt` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-201.png)

Stage and commit this file:

```sh
git add another_file.txt
git commit -m "another file"
```

Now, change this file by adding a new line, and also erasing the line before the last one:

![Changes to <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`another_file.txt` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-202.png)

Observe the difference between the original version of the file and the version including your changes:

```sh
git diff -- another_file.txt
```

![The output for `git diff -- another_file.txt` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-203.png)

(Using `-- another_file.txt` tells Git to run the command `diff`, taking into consideration only <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`another_file.txt`, so you don't get the diff for other files.)

Store this diff into a patch file:

```sh
git diff -- another_file.txt > new_patch.patch
```

Now, reset your state to that before introducing the changes: `git reset --hard`

If you were to apply `new_patch.patch` now, it would simply work. Consider a more interesting case.

Modify <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`another_file.txt` again by adding a new line at the beginning:

![Adding a new line at the beginning of <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`another_file.txt` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-209.png)

As a result, the line numbers are different from the original version where the patch has been created. Consider the patch you created before:

![`new_patch.patch` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-210.png)

It assumes that the line `So this is a file` is the first line in <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`another_file.txt`, which is no longer the case. So...will `git apply` work?

![`git apply` doesn't apply the patch <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-211.png)

Well, no. The patch does not apply. But why? Is it really because of the change in line numbers?

To better understand the process Git is performing, you can add the `--verbose` flag to `git apply`, like so:

```sh
git apply --verbose new_patch.patch
```

![`git apply --verbose` shows the process Git is taking to apply the patch <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-213.png)

It seems that Git searched for the entire contents of the file, specifically, including the line `So we are writing an example`, that no longer exists in the file. As Git cannot find this line, it cannot apply the patch.

Why does Git look for the entire file? By default, Git looks for `3` lines of context before and after each change introduced in the patch. If you take three lines before and after the added line, and three lines before and after the deleted line (actually only one line after, as no other lines exist) - you get to the entire file.

You can ask Git to rely on fewer lines of context, using the `-C` argument. For example, to ask Git to look for `1` line of the surrounding context, run the following command:

```sh
git apply -C1 new_patch.patch
```

The patch applies cleanly! üéâ

Why is that? Consider the patch again:

![`new_patch.patch` <br/><Source: [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>Brief](https://youtu.be/eG9oAroMcPk)>](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/02/image-210.png)

When applying the patch with the `-C1` option, Git is looking for the lines:

```plaintext
It has some really nice lines
Like this one
```

in order to add the line `!!!This is the new line I am adding!!!` between these two lines. These lines exist (and, importantly, they appear one right after the other). So Git can successfully add the line between them, even though the line numbers changed.

Similarly, Git would look for the lines:

```plaintext
And we are now learning about Git
So we are writing an example
Git is lovely!
```

As Git can find these lines, Git can erase the middle one.

If we changed one of these lines, say, changed `And we are now learning about Git` to `And we are now learning about patches in Git`, then Git would not be able to find the string above, and thus the patch would not apply.

## Recap

In this post, you learned what a diff is, and the difference between a diff and a patch. You learned how to generate various patches using different switches for `git diff`.

You also learned what the output of `git diff` looks like, and how it is constructed. Ultimately, you learned how patches are applied, and specifically the importance of context.

Understanding diffs is a major milestone for understanding many other processes within Git - for example, merging or rebasing.

In future tutorials, you will use your knowledge from this post to dive into these other areas of Git.
