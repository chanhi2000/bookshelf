Open-source software has transformed the tech industry, creating powerful opportunities for learning, growth, and collaboration. By contributing to open-source projects, you can build essential coding skills, gain real-world experience, and make meaningful connections with other developers across the globe.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know about contributing to open-source software. Taught by James Pearce, the former Head of Open Source at Meta and the creator of his own open-source project, TinyBase, this course is designed to help you transition from open-source consumer to active contributor. Whether you're just beginning to explore coding or are already an experienced developer, this course will guide you through the key steps to make valuable contributions to open-source projects.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of the course, you’ll understand the many rewards of open-source contributions, including opportunities to build your skills, enhance your career, and influence the tech industry. The course starts with open-source fundamentals, covering terms like “repository,” “pull request,” “issues,” and “commits.” You’ll learn how to evaluate projects for contribution, find projects that align with your skills and interests, and assess a project’s health and activity. This knowledge will help you select contributions that are rewarding and impactful.

One of the biggest challenges for new contributors is understanding a new codebase. This course demystifies that process, with practical guidance on identifying the most important parts of a project, understanding its structure, and navigating its social dynamics. You’ll also learn the steps for making and submitting changes, increasing the likelihood that your contributions will be reviewed and accepted quickly. James offers proven strategies to ensure your work is trusted and valued by the project community, paving the way for future contributions.

Here are some key topics covered in this course:

- **Understanding Open-Source Basics**: Learn the terminology and foundational concepts that power the open-source ecosystem.
- **Identifying Projects to Contribute To**: Discover how to find and assess projects that align with your interests and skills.
- **Navigating a New Codebase**: Get strategies to quickly make sense of large codebases and understand where your efforts can have the most impact.
- **Submitting Your Code**: Learn best practices for making commits and submitting pull requests in a way that fosters trust and collaboration.


This course offers a step-by-step roadmap for breaking into open-source, making it easier to contribute confidently and consistently. It’s a unique opportunity to learn directly from a leader in the field who has dedicated much of his career to open-source advancement.
