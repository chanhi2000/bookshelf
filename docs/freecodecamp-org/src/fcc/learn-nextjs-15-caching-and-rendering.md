Learn Next.js 15 Caching & Rendering using the App Router.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel for people who want a clear, engineering-level understanding of how Next.js optimizes performance through smart rendering strategies and layered caching. This course was developed by Sumit Saha.

You'll gain a deep understanding of Next.js rendering strategies, including Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR). You'll also explore the intricacies of React Client and Server Components, along with the React Server Component (RSC) payload. Furthermore, the course will cover various Next.js caching strategies, such as Request Memoization, Data Cache, Full Route Cache, and Router Cache, all reinforced with practical examples to facilitate hands-on learning.

Here are the sections in this course:

- Intro
- What is Caching
- Rendering Strategies - SSG SSR ISR CSR
- React Client & Server Components - Hydration
- RSC Payload
- How Rendering works in Next.js
- Why Caching Strategies
- Discover Caching Strategies
- 3W & 3H Framework
- Request Memoization Example
- Request Memoization Summary with Animation
- Request Memoization - 3W & 3H Question Answers
- Request Memoization - Points to Remember
- Data Cache Example
- Data Cache Summary with Animation
- Data Cache - 3W & 3H Question Answers
- Data Cache - Points to Remember
- Full Route Cache Example
- Full Route Cache Summary with Animation
- Full Route Cache - 3W & 3H Question Answers
- Full Route Cache - Points to Remember
- Router Cache Example
- Router Cache Summary with Diagram
- Router Cache - 3W & 3H Question Answers
- Go through the Documentation
- unstable_cache & use cache
- Wrap Up
