Linear algebra is a fundamental building block of machine learning. Whether you are working with deep learning models, optimization algorithms, or computer vision applications, understanding linear algebra concepts can give you a solid mathematical foundation to grasp how these models function under the hood. If you've ever wondered how matrices, vectors, and transformations play a role in AI, now is the perfect time to dive into this essential topic.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about **linear algebra for machine learning**. This comprehensive course is created by **Tatev Aslanyan from Lunar Tech**, and it is designed to provide a deep understanding of the mathematical concepts that power modern machine learning algorithms. Whether you are a beginner looking to strengthen your math skills or a machine learning practitioner aiming to refine your understanding, this course will equip you with the necessary tools to work confidently with linear algebra in AI and data science.

::: important Why Linear Algebra Matters for Machine Learning

Linear algebra is at the heart of machine learning and deep learning. Here are some key areas where it plays a crucial role:

- **Data Representation**: In machine learning, data is often represented as matrices and vectors. For example, images in computer vision models are stored as multi-dimensional arrays, and word embeddings in natural language processing are vectors in high-dimensional space.
- **Transformations and Operations**: Matrix operations like multiplication, transposition, and inversion are widely used in algorithms, especially in neural networks and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **Optimization and Training**: Many machine learning models rely on optimization methods like gradient descent, which heavily depend on matrix calculus and linear algebra techniques.
- **Eigenvalues and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**: Concepts like eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and SVD are essential for principal component analysis (PCA) and other machine learning applications that involve data compression and feature extraction.
