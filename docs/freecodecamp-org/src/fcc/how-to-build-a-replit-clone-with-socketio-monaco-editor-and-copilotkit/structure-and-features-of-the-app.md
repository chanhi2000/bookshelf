The focus of this project is on simplicity and functionality, to replicate Replit's core features like code editing and real-time previews. The idea is to create a straightforward web application that lets you:

- Host three essential components: a File Explorer, the Monaco Editor, and a Sandbox.
- Open files generated by CopilotKit in the Monaco Editor and perform CRUD operations on them.
- See the real-time output of your code as you work.
- Chat with the CopilotKit chatbot, which will be fully integrated into the front end.

The plan is to keep the implementation clean and practical while delivering a smooth coding experience.

## Webpage Structure

Since we’ve already set up the Next.js app, the next step is to create a minimalistic webpage with the following components:

1. **File Explorer:** Displays the files generated by CopilotKit.
2. **Monaco Editor:** A versatile code editor that handles various file types and displays the content.
3. **Sandbox:** Shows the real-time output of the code.
4. **CopilotKit Chatbot:** Generates code files based on natural language prompts.

---

## Key Features

- **Error Handling:** Any failures, such as API or database issues, will be highlighted with red text for immediate visibility.
- **Data Presentation:** Data is presented in two parts: first in the File Explorer for code files, and second in the Monaco Editor for viewing the content of those files.
- **CopilotKit Chatbot Integration:** The chatbot will allow natural language interactions with the database. The blue-coloured ball on the page represents the CopilotKit chatbot, which serves as the key interface for interacting with the database.
  - Users can ask questions about the database using natural language.
  - The chatbot processes these queries, converts them into SQL, and fetches the results seamlessly.

The front end will look something like this: [<FontIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>https://replit-mongodb.vercel.app/](https://replit-mongodb.vercel.app/)
