Terminals have a long history. It started as an upgrade from [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-wikipedia-w"/>punch cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card). Computers back in the day used teletypes, which was just a keyboard and a printer. You'd type on the keyboard, and the keystrokes would be sent to the computer (usually mainframe) and the output got printed on a printer.

Later on, the teletypes were replaced with terminals. A terminal was like the dump computer we see today. It was a CRT Monitor with a keyboard. So instead of getting the output on the printer, it would be displayed on the monitor.

Today we still use this type of interface (the Command Line) to talk with computers.

The command line is a terminal emulator and is a big part of Unix systems, like GNU/Linux or MacOS. On Windows, you have PowerShell or cmd.exe file that allows you to type commands and get responses in the form of text. You can also install GNU/Linux system on Windows in the form of WSL. CLI interfaces are used mostly by power users, developers, and system administrators.

If you're new to the command line, you can read this article:
