Now that weâ€™ve created our npm package, the next step is **publishing it to the npm registry** so others can install and use it. In this section, weâ€™ll cover how to publish the package step by step.

---

## Creating an npm Account

Before publishing, you need an npm account.

### Step 1: Sign Up for npm

1. Go to [https://npmjs.com/signup](https://npmjs.com/signup) and create an account.
2. Verify your email address.

### Step 2: Log in to npm from the Terminal

Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm login
```

You will be prompted to enter:

- Your npm username
- Your password
- Your email (associated with your npm account)

If the login is successful, youâ€™ll see a message:

```plaintext title="output"
Logged in as your-username on https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

## Configuring package.json for Publishing

### Step 3: Ensure Your Package Name is Unique

Every npm package needs a unique name. Run the following command to check if your desired name is available:

```sh
npm search my-awesome-library
```

If the name is already taken, youâ€™ll need to modify <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-json"/>`package.json` and change the `"name"` field.

### Step 4: Add Metadata and Keywords

Open `package.json` and ensure it includes useful metadata:

```json{2} title="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-awesome-library",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple npm package for formatting dates",
  "main": "index.js",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/my-awesome-library.git"
  },
  "keywords": ["date", "formatter", "utility", "npm package"],
  "author": "Your Name <your-email@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

ðŸ”¹ **repository** - Useful if you plan to host the project on GitHub.  
ðŸ”¹ **keywords** - Helps people discover your package on npm.  
ðŸ”¹ **license** - Specifies how others can use your package (for example, MIT, GPL, and so on).

## Publishing the Package

### Step 5: Publish Your Package to npm

Run the following command inside your project folder:

```sh
npm publish
```

If successful, youâ€™ll see output similar to:

```plaintext title="output"
+ my-awesome-library@1.0.0
```

Your package is now available at:

**ðŸ“Œ [https://www.npmjs.com/package/my-awesome-library](https://npmjs.com/package/my-awesome-library)**

### Step 6: Making Changes and Updating the Package

If you want to release a new version, update the `version` field in <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-json"/>`package.json`. npm follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **Patch:** Bug fixes (1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1)
- **Minor:** New features, backward-compatible (1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0)
- **Major:** Breaking changes (1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0)

Instead of manually updating `package.json`, use:

```sh
npm version patch   # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1
npm version minor   # 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0
npm version major   # 1.0.0 â†’ 2.0.0
```

Then, publish the new version:

```sh
npm publish
```

If you accidentally publish a package and need to remove it:

```sh
npm unpublish my-awesome-library --force
```

::: note

You can only unpublish packages **within 72 hours** of publishing.

:::

ðŸŽ¯ **Youâ€™ve successfully published your own npm library!** Now, other developers can install it using:

```sh
npm install my-awesome-library
```

By following Semantic Versioning, writing clear documentation, and maintaining your package, you contribute to the open-source ecosystem and make your code reusable.
