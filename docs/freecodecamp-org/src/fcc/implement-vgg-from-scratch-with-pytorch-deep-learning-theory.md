Visual Geometry Group (VGG) is one of the most influential convolutional neural networks in computer vision. It is a deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its simple, uniform use of small 3x3 filters stacked in sequence, enabling powerful image recognition and feature extraction.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you to rebuild the VGG architecture from the ground up while mastering the theory, mathematics, and design principles that shaped it. Mohammed Al Abrah created this course.

This course explores the origins and philosophy behind VGG, breaks down the math of convolutions, and compares VGG’s design to its peer architectures, all while building a modular, transparent implementation in PyTorch. You’ll gain practical experience with data handling, transformation, and visualization in Google Colab, and use tools like torchinfo, matplotlib, and CNN Explainer to analyze and interpret your models. The course features a full training loop with live loss curve plotting, fine-tuning, and plenty of opportunities to experiment and visualize results.

Here is the full list of sections in the course:

- Welcome & Overview of the VGG Atlas
- Philosophy Behind VGG: Depth with Simplicity
- Historical Origins & Architectural Motivation
- Mathematics of Convolution in VGG
- Design Principles: Uniformity & Depth
- Peer Comparison: VGG vs Contemporary Architectures
