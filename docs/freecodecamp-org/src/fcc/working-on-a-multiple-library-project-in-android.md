In this article, we're going to talk about multi-library projects in Android. It's not something ordinary, but not something out of the ordinary either. 

You may have come across multi-library projects in your line of work, or you may be looking into converting your library into sub-modules for better structure and organization. No matter the case, you should be well aware of what lies in front of you before diving in.

Writing your own library in Android is neat. You get a chance to write some code that can help other developers (or even yourself). 

Since libraries canâ€™t be a standalone project by themselves, they are usually always paired in a project with an application. This allows developing the library to be a simple process where you add a feature/fix a bug and then you can test it directly with the application you have in the project. Thus, simulating (in a local way) how a developer will integrate your library.

But, what if your library relies on another library you are developing?

If you are not aware of it, you should know that a library (read aar) cannot contain another local library within it. It can rely on libraries remotely (via dependencies), but not on something local. 

This is not supported in Android, and while some solutions popped up during the years ([FatAar (<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`kezong/fat-aar-android`)](https://github.com/kezong/fat-aar-android)), these didnâ€™t always solve the problem and are not up to date. There is even a [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-google"/>Google Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/62121508?pli=1) requesting this feature that has been open for quite some time and is receiving plenty of attention from the community. But letâ€™s identify which walls we can break and which we cannot.

Imagine your project hierarchy looks like this:

::: info The structure of our project

```
-- App
|
 -- OuterLib
   |
    --- InnerLib
```

:::

So, since InnerLib canâ€™t be part of your original project, where can it reside? And also how would you be able to work locally while developing features inside InnerLib?

We are going to answer these questions in this article.

---

## Git Submodule

For most technical problems, there isnâ€™t always just one solution. Usually, there are more, but each solution has its drawbacks. It's all a question of which drawbacks you are more comfortable living with at the end of the day.

To answer our first question, where can InnerLib reside, we have several options:

1. Make InnerLib a submodule of our original project
2. Make InnerLib a remote dependency of its own

If you are not aware of submodules in Git, [<FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-git"/>Gitâ€™s documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) is a good place to familiarize yourself with them. Quoting from it (the first paragraph):

> It often happens that while working on one project, you need to use another project from within it. ðŸ‘‰ Perhaps itâ€™s a library that a third party developed or that youâ€™re developing separately and using in multiple parent projects. ðŸ‘ˆ A common issue arises in these scenarios: you want to be able to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.

This paragraph shows us that this is exactly our use case. Using a submodule has its benefits. All your code is in one place, is easy to manage, and is easy to develop locally.

But submodules have some weaknesses. One is the fact that you must always be aware of which branch your submodule is pointing to. Imagine a scenario where you are on a release branch in your main repository and your sub-module is on a feature branch. If you donâ€™t notice, you release a version of your code with something that is not ready for production. Whoops.

Now think about this within a team of developers. One careless mistake can be costly.

If the first option sounds problematic for you, then hosting your library in another repository is your second choice. Setting up the repository is pretty simple, but how do you work locally now?

---

## Working Locally

Now that we've gotten our project set up properly, we will probably have a line similar to this in our OuterLib <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'url_to_remote_inner_lib_repository'
}
```

How can we make the development cycle efficient and easy to work with? If we develop some feature in `InnerLib`, how do we test things out in `OuterLib`? Or in our application?

One solution that might come up is to import our InnerLib locally to our `OuterLib` project, while having `InnerLib` .gitignored in our `OuterLib` project. You can do so easily by right clicking on the name of the project in the left hand side menu in Android Studio and going to <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-select"/>`[New]` â†’ `[Module]`.

![How to import a module (Step 1)](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/04/1.jpg)

Then in the window that opens up, you can choose the Import option at the bottom left:

![How to import a module (Step 2)](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/04/1-1.jpg)

That sounds easy and simple so far, but whatâ€™s the catch?

Each time you modify a file that belongs to `InnerLib`, the changes wonâ€™t be reflected inside `InnerLib` since it is ignored. So, each change you want to make has to happen inside of `InnerLib` and then you have to import it again inside OuterLib to see the changes.

This doesnâ€™t seem right. There must be a better way of doing this.

With just a few lines in our <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`settings.gradle` file, we can make sure our files stay in sync when we make changes in `InnerLib`. 

When we imported `InnerLib` into our project, Android Studio made a copy of InnerLib and cached it. That is why we needed to re-import the library for every change we made inside of it. We can tell Android Studio where to reference the files from using the `projectDir` attribute. 

Our <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`settings.gradle` might look something like this:

```groovy
include ':outerLib', ':innerLib', ':app'
```

To reference our `InnerLib` locally, we would have to change <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`settings.gradle` into this:

```groovy
include ':outerLib', ':innerLib', ':app'
project('innerLib').projectDir = new File('PATH_TO_INNER_LIB')
```

Using this approach, our `InnerLib` files will be linked to our working directory, so every change we make will be reflected immediately.

But, we would like flexibility when working locally on OuterLib with a remote version of `InnerLib`. What we wrote above inside the settings.gradle file will only allow us to work locally and surely we donâ€™t want to commit that as it is.

---

## Maven Local

If the approach above doesnâ€™t sit quite right with you, there is a different one you can take. Just like you would publish your library publicly with maven, you can do the same thing locally with maven local. Maven local is a set of repositories that sit locally on your machine.

Below are the paths for `mavenLocal` depending on the operating system of your machine:

::: tabs

@tab:active <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-macos"/>Mac

<FontIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.m2`

@tab <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-linux"/>Linux

<FontIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.m2`

@tab <FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-windows"/>Windows

<FontIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.m2`

:::

In essence you can publish your library locally and then link to it in your project. Doing it this way, we can link our project to `InnerLib`.

In order to allow this configuration in our project, we need to do the following things:

::: tabs

@tab:active 1.

Add `mavenLocal()` as a repository inside our repositories clause. This is to allow our project the ability to search for repositories locally

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
}

/* ... */

allprojects { 
    repositories { 
        mavenLocal() 
    }
}
```

@tab 2.

Change our implementation line inside our dependencies clause to reference our InnerLib as if it we are referencing it remotely

@tab 3.

To publish `InnerLib` locally, we will create a file called <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`publishingLocally.gradle` that will contain the following:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'maven-publish' 

project.afterEvaluate {
  publishing { 
    publications {
      library(MavenPublication) { 
        setGroupId groupId          // your library package
        setArtifactId artifactId              
        version versionName         //I.E. 1.0

        artifact bundleDebugAar

        pom.withXml { 
            def dependenciesNode = asNode().appendNode('dependencies')
            def dependencyNode = dependenciesNode.appendNode('dependency')
            dependencyNode.appendNode('groupId', 'your_group_id')
            dependencyNode.appendNode('artifactId', 'your_artificat_id')
            dependencyNode.appendNode('version', 'your_version')
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

@tab 4.

Inside your application level <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`build.gradle` file, add the line:

```groovy
apply from: '/.publishingLocally.gradle
```

:::

If this option seems a bit too good to be true, **it is**. While on one hand, we can develop things locally seamlessly just as if we were working with a remote library. On the other, if we make any change inside InnerLib while working locally, it is required to publish it locally again. While this isnâ€™t a costly task, it does create a need to perform tedious tasks over and over.

## A Solution for Working Locally and Remotely

We want to avoid the constant need to re-publish our InnerLib package whenever we make a change locally. We need to figure out a way to make our project be aware of those changes.

In the Working Locally section, we found out how to do that, but we had an issue with committing the settings.gradle file. To solve this problem so we can work both locally and remotely with our InnerLib, we will use a parameter we will define in our <FontIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`gradle.properties` file.

The gradle.properties file is a place where you can store project level settings that configure your development environment. This helps make sure that all the developers on a team have a consistent development environment. 

Some settings you might be familiar with that are found inside this file are AndroidX support (`android.useAndroidX=true`) or the JVM arguments (`org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536m`).

To help us solve our situation, we can add a parameter here to indicate whether we want to work locally or not. Something along the lines of:

```groovy
workingLocally = false
```

This parameter will grant us the ability to distinguish between which settings we are working with, either locally or with production code. First, letâ€™s alter what we have in our <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`settings.gradle` file by wrapping it in a condition that checks if our parameter is true:

```groovy
include ':outerLib', ':innerLib', ':app'
if (workingLocally.booleanValue()) {
  project('innerLib').projectDir = new File('PATH_TO_INNER_LIB')
}
```

This way, we indicate to the project to get the files for our InnerLib locally from our machine. 

Another place where we need to change our logic is in our <FontIcon icon="iconfont icon-gradle"/>`build.gradle` file. Here, instead of getting the code to our library remotely in our dependencies block, we can indicate whether we are depending on it locally or not.

```groovy
dependencies {
   if (workingLocally.booleanValue()) {
      implementation 'innerLib'
   } else {
     implementation 'url_to_remote_repository'
  }
}
```

::: warning Word of warning

You should never commit the <FontIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`gradle.properties` file when working locally.

:::

The journey was long and may have seemed quite exhausting. But now we have a full-proof setup for working locally and remotely on a multiple library project.
