Want to learn how to combine React 19 and AI LLMs to build something handy?

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you to build an AI-powered Code Explainer App from scratch. Tapas Adhikary created this course.

Learn to design the app, configure an Express.js backend, set up a REST endpoint that talks to an LLM, and then integrate everything into a modern React 19 app (with Vite + TailwindCSS).

By the end you’ll have a working AI Code Explainer tool that takes any code snippet and returns clear, beginner-friendly explanations. Along the way, you’ll also learn about React 19’s new features like `useActionState` and Server Actions, plus best practices for API integration and error handling.

This course covers:

- How to design and plan an AI project
- Configuring Express.js for REST APIs
- Connecting to an LLM for code explanation
- Testing APIs with Postman
- Building a modern frontend with React 19, Vite, and TailwindCSS
- Using React 19’s `useActionState` + Server Actions in real projects
- Handling API responses and formatting output

Watch the full course [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/W4M-g9wsEC4) (1-hour watch).
