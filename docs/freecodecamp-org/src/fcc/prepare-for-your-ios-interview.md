Preparing for an iOS developer interview can be a daunting task, especially when you're trying to master both conceptual questions and practical coding challenges. Whether you're just starting your iOS development journey or gearing up for your next big career move, understanding the most commonly asked interview questions and knowing how to answer them effectively can give you a major advantage.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about the top 10 most frequently asked iOS interview questions, complete with sample answers and code demonstrations. Presented by Richard Topchii, this mock interview format course features Daniel as the interviewer and covers everything from foundational concepts to nuanced language features in Swift.

The course kicks off with an overview and a discussion of why these specific questions were chosen, followed by a deep dive into essential iOS concepts like the View Controller life cycle, and the differences between structs and classes, which is a crucial topic for understanding memory management and data handling in Swift. You’ll also learn the distinctions between `.frame` and `.bounds` in UIViews, an area where developers are often tested for their understanding of layout behavior.

Beyond the fundamentals, the course explores more advanced topics such as Protocol-Oriented Programming, MVC architecture, and important Swift keywords like `lazy`, `weak`, `unowned`, and `@escaping`. These are often tricky areas that interviewers use to assess a candidate's depth of knowledge and real-world coding experience. Plus, with real coding questions on the `defer` statement and GCD / `DispatchQueue`, you'll get to see how to write performant and safe concurrent code.

By the end of the video, you’ll also get a summary and feedback section that ties all the concepts together, helping reinforce what you've learned. Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/SLIlyAy-aZs) (1-hour watch).
