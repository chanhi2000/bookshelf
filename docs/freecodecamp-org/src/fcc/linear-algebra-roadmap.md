## Core Concepts in Linear Algebra that You Will Actually Use

Let's dive into the heart of linear algebra and explore the core concepts that you will leverage daily in your Data Science, Machine Learning, or AI journey.

### Vectors and Matrices: The Building Blocks of Your Data

Think of vectors as lists of numbers (like NumPy arrays), and matrices as tables of numbers (multiple arrays stacked next to each other). In the world of data science and AI, vectors and matrices are your bread and butter.

**Vectors** can represent anything from customer characteristics (salary, age, height, income, purchase history) to word embeddings (numerical representations of words, text, and strings in general in natural language processing [NLP]). These vectors in datasets are commonly referred to as features – or, if used as response variables, as labels, dependent variables, and so on.

**Matrices** are powerful data structures that store datasets, with each row representing a data point and each column representing a feature. When you load your data and store it in a dataframe, all the rows of your data are basically the rows of your matrix, while all the features and response variables combined are the columns in your matrix.

Simple vector or matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication of vectors and matrices are tools for data manipulation and transformation. These tools are used to normalize or standardize features, scale the data, combine different datasets or even perform forward pass/backward pass when training neural networks.

Linear algebra operations all power these common and daily tasks in Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Linear Transformations: Manipulating and Transforming Data

In the world of data, transformations are the key. You need transformations to rotate an image and resize it.

These are also common ways to perform data augmentation in Computer Vision. Maybe you want to adjust the colors or contrast. These tasks are all done through linear transformations, which are essentially functions that map one set of data points to another.

In the world of linear algebra, multiplying a matrix by a vector (or another matrix), transposing the matrix and inverting it, is like applying a specific transformation to your data. This is incredibly powerful for:

- **Image and signal processing:** Enhancing images, removing noise, or transforming audio signals.
- **Data preprocessing:** Scaling features, standardizing variables, and preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Feature engineering:** Creating new features by combining or manipulating existing ones through linear combinations.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: The Essence of Your Data

Think of eigenvalues and eigenvectors as the DNA of your data matrix. These sets of important values reveal the fundamental characteristics and directions, respectively, of largest variation (information).

Once you know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you can quickly figure out which features in your data contain the most variation (that is information). This is basically your golden ticket for feature selection.

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are essential in linear algebra, as they offer insights into matrix properties. They are particularly useful across various disciplines such as engineering, physics, data science and AI.

- **Eigenvalues** indicate the factor by which an eigenvector is scaled by a matrix, revealing key properties like system stability or oscillation.
- **Eigenvectors** are vectors that remain directed along the same line under a matrix transformation, only scaled in magnitude. They help simplify complex systems and elucidate structural properties of transformations.

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors are essential for:

- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):** PCA uses eigenvectors to identify the directions of greatest variation (variance) in your data, allowing you to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information.
- **PageRank Algorithm:** Google's famous algorithm uses eigenvectors to determine the importance of web pages.
- **Understanding data clusters:** Eigenvectors help us to identify groups or clusters within your data.

Don't be intimidated by the names – eigenvalues and eigenvectors are simply numbers and vectors that describe the inherent structure of your data. Understanding them gives you a powerful lens through which to analyze and interpret complex datasets.

### Matrix Factorization: Uncover Hidden Patterns in Your Data

Imagine a massive table of article ratings from thousands of users. Hidden within this data are patterns that reveal user preferences and article similarities.

Matrix factorization, particularly a technique called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), is the key to creating such a recommender system.

SVD breaks down large matrices into smaller, more manageable matrices that reveal what are called latent factors. These are the underlying characteristics that explain why users rate things (like movies) the way they do. This is the algorithm behind famous recommendation systems like Amazon or Netflix, which use these latent factors to suggest items and movies you'll love.

But matrix factorization isn't just for building powerful recommender systems. It's a versatile tool used for:

- **Dimensionality reduction:** Simplify your data by identifying the most important features.
- **Topic modeling:** Discover hidden topics in a collection of documents.
- **Image compression:** Reduce the size of image files without sacrificing too much quality.
- **Recommendation systems:** Predict user preferences and similarities to generate meaningful recommendations and suggest relevant items.

## Linear Algebra in Action: Real-World Applications in Data Science, AI, and Beyond

Mathematics is like producer of the movies: you don't see them but they are actually running the show.

In this section, we'll delve into specific examples that showcase the practical power of linear algebra across various cutting edge fields. You'll see how seemingly abstract concepts translate into real-world solutions that drive innovation and impact our daily lives.

Let's explore how linear algebra is revolutionizing many different industries.

### Linear Algebra in Data Science and Machine Learning

#### Linear Regression

**Linear Regression**, which is a fundamental ML algorithm, relies on linear algebra to find the best-fit line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

Matrices and vectors are used to represent data and model parameters, while matrix operations like inversion and transpose are crucial for solving the regression equations.

::: tip Application - House Price Prediction

Predicting housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. You can check out a complete end-to-end [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>case study here](https://youtu.be/tbvNGN5dBuE&t=104s).

Imagine you're a real estate agent trying to predict the price of a house. You have data on various features of different houses: the square footage, the number of bedrooms, and so on.

These features are put into a table-like structure called a matrix, denoted as X. Each row of X represents a different house, and each column represents a specific feature – for instance, one column might be the square footage, another the number of bedrooms. The prices of the corresponding houses are stored in another matrix, Y.

Your goal is to predict the price (Y) of a new house based on its features (X). Linear regression uses linear algebra to find the relationship between these features and the price.

The "line of best fit" is defined by a set of coefficients called Beta (β). Each element in Beta corresponds to a particular feature in X and tells you how much that feature influences the final price. We also add an error term, epsilon (ε), to account for any random variation in house prices that can't be explained by the features we have.

Under the hood, linear regression uses matrix operations like **transposes, inverses, and matrix multiplication** to calculate the Beta values that give the best prediction. So, while you might not see the complex math directly, linear algebra is the engine that powers the price estimates you see on real estate websites!

#### Logistic Regression

This algorithm uses linear algebra to model the relationship between customer features (like tenure, usage patterns, and demographics) and the probability of churn. Coefficients learned through linear algebra determine the importance of each feature in predicting churn.

::: tip Application - Customer Churn Prediction

A telecommunications company might use logistic regression to identify customers at high risk of switching to a competitor. The model analyzes factors like call duration, data usage, customer service interactions, and billing issues.

:::

#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**SVM** is a powerful classification algorithm that uses linear algebra to find the optimal hyperplane separating different classes of data. The concept of vector dot products is central to calculating distances and determining the margin between classes.

::: tip Application - Spam Email Identification

classifies emails as spam or not spam based on features like word frequency and email length.

:::

#### Feature Extraction

Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) leverage linear algebra to extract the most important features from image data, reducing dimensionality and improving computational efficiency.

::: Application - Object Detection

Object detection algorithms often use PCA to reduce the complexity of image features before classification.

:::

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**PCA** leverages linear algebra, specifically eigenvalues and eigenvectors, to identify the directions of greatest variance in high-dimensional data. By projecting data onto these principal components, PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving the most important information.

::: tip Application - Genomics

In genomics research, PCA is used to analyze gene expression data from thousands of genes. By reducing the dimensionality of the data, researchers can more easily visualize patterns and identify relationships between genes.

:::

### Linear Algebra in Deep Learning and Generative AI

#### Neural Networks

The foundation of deep learning, neural networks are essentially interconnected layers of nodes (neurons) that process information using linear algebra operations. Matrices represent weights and biases, while matrix multiplication and activation functions propagate signals through the network.

::: tip Application - Image Classification with CNNs

Image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where linear algebra is used for filtering operations and feature extraction.

:::

#### Image Transformations

Linear algebra is used extensively for image manipulation, including rotation, scaling, translation, and shearing. Matrices are used to represent these transformations, and matrix multiplication is used to apply them to images.

::: tip Application in Facial Recognition

Facial recognition software uses linear transformations to align and normalize face images for comparison.

:::

#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**GAN**s, a type of generative model, use linear algebra operations within their neural networks to learn and generate new data samples, such as images or text.

::: tip Application in Generating Images

Generating realistic images of human faces or creating artwork in the style of famous painters.

:::

#### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

These generative models use linear algebra to encode high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional latent space. This space is structured to follow a standard distribution (usually a Gaussian), making it easier to sample new data points and generate diverse outputs. Matrix operations are crucial for encoding and decoding data between the original space and the latent space.

::: tip Application in Healthcare with VAE

A pharmaceutical company uses VAEs to generate novel molecular structures with desired properties. By encoding existing drug molecules into a latent space, the VAE can explore this space to generate new candidate molecules that potentially have therapeutic effects.

All these examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Linear algebra plays an important role in countless applications across data science and AI. By understanding its core concepts, you'll be equipped to not only use existing algorithms but also contribute to the development of new and innovative solutions.
