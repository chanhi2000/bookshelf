We just posted course on freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to transform messy, hard-to-maintain JavaScript code into clean, readable, and professional-quality code that scales.

This course was developed by Tapas Adhikary. He'll help you understand what Code Smell is, why it matters, and how to refactor step-by-step using proven clean code principles, real examples, and modern tooling like ESLint + Prettier. You'll learn to write code that is maintainable, elegant, and future-proof.

The course covers:

- What Code Smell means and how to detect it
- Why clean code matters in real-world software development
- Common categories of Code Smells with JavaScript examples
- How to refactor smelly code into clean, readable code
- Practical demo of ESLint + Prettier for automated clean-up
- Best practices, patterns, and mindset for writing maintainable code
- Assignments and next steps to continue your clean code journey

Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/626BcUO84og) (1-hour watch).
