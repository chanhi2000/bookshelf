Are you ready to take your web hosting skills to the next level by using a CSS template? Hosting a professional looking website doesnâ€™t have to be complicated, and with AWS EC2, you can have your website live in no time!

In this guide, Iâ€™ll show you how to host a website using a pre-designed template from [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>**CSS templates**](https://free-css.com/free-css-templates) directly on your EC2 instance.

Before we dive into this guide, make sure youâ€™ve gone through my [previous blog](/freecodecamp.org/how-to-launch-an-ec2-instance-and-a-web-server-using-httpd.md) on how to launch and connect to an EC2 instance. If you havenâ€™t set up an EC2 instance yet, head over to that post first to get your instance up and running. Once thatâ€™s done, youâ€™re all set to proceed!

---

## Step 1: Download the "Built Better" Template

For this tutorial, weâ€™ll use the Built Better template, which is free and easy to set up.

Head over to [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>this link](https://free-css.com/free-css-templates/page284/built-better) and download the template.

Right-click on the download button and select "Copy clean link". Weâ€™ll use this link to download the template directly into your EC2 instance.

---

## Step 2: Download the Template Directly to Your EC2 Instance

Now that you have the link to the template, letâ€™s download it straight to your EC2 instance using `wget`.

Log in to your EC2 instance via SSH or MobaXterm (as covered in my [previous blog](/freecodecamp.org/connect-to-your-ec2-instance-using-mobaxterm.md)) and navigate to the <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`/var/www/html` directory where your website files will be stored:

```sh
cd /var/www/html
```

Use the `wget` command followed by the copied link to download the "Built Better" template directly into your EC2 instance:

```sh
sudo wget https://www.free-css.com/assets/files/free-css-templates/download/page284/built-better.zip
```

::: note

After downloading, it's a good idea to check the file name to ensure it matches the file used in the subsequent commands. You can do this by running the `ls` command:

```sh
ls
```

:::

---

## Step 3: Unzip the Template Files

Now that the template has been downloaded, itâ€™s time to extract it. Install the `unzip` utility if itâ€™s not already installed:

```sh
sudo dnf install unzip -y
```

Then unzip the template:

```sh
sudo unzip built-better.zip -d /var/www/html/
```

After unzipping, make sure to check the folder name where the files were extracted from. You can do this by listing the contents of the <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`/var/www/html` directory:

```sh
ls /var/www/html/
```

In this case, the unzipped contents are located inside a folder named <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`html`. This folder contains all the template files. If the folder name is different in your case, adjust the following steps accordingly.

First, move the files from the <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`html` folder to the root <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`/var/www/html/` directory:

```sh
sudo mv /var/www/html/html/* /var/www/html/
```

Then remove the unnecessary folder:

```sh
sudo rm -r /var/www/html/html
```

Lastly, remove the ZIP file:

```sh
sudo rm built-better.zip
```

---

## Step 4: Set Up the Web Server to Host Your Template

If you havenâ€™t already, make sure your Apache HTTPD web server is installed and running. You can follow these steps to ensure your server is ready:

Install Apache (if not installed):

```sh
sudo yum install httpd -y
```

Start the Apache service:

```sh
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

Enable Apache to start on boot:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

Now your web server should be up and running, ready to serve your template.

## Step 5: Test Your Website

Now for the exciting part seeing your site live! Open a browser and navigate to your EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP address. You should now see the Built Better template live and ready to go.

Hereâ€™s how to check:

- Find your EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP from the AWS EC2 dashboard.
- Enter the IP in your browser, like so: `http://your-ec2-public-ip`
- Your website should now be live with the Built Better template! ðŸŽ‰

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully hosted a professional-looking website using the Built Better CSS template on your EC2 instance.

With just a few steps, youâ€™ve moved from launching an EC2 instance to hosting a fully styled website, all using the AWS powerful cloud infrastructure.
