Mobile app development has evolved tremendously, and creating a robust, full-featured app today involves mastering both the front-end and back-end. If you're looking to build something practical, like an e-commerce platform, and want to learn the ins and outs of native mobile app development, this course has you covered. You'll be guided through the process of building a complete gadgets-selling platform, starting from the front-end design with React Native to setting up a secure back-end with Supabase, handling payments with Stripe, and even deploying the app with Next.js for the admin panel.

We just published a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about developing native mobile apps using React Native, Supabase, Stripe, and Next.js. This course is designed to take you through the entire process of building a complete e-commerce platform, making it an ideal project for anyone looking to strengthen their full-stack development skills. Whether you're new to mobile development or looking to expand your knowledge, this course covers everything step by step. Alaribe Bright developed this course.

## What You’ll Learn

1. **React Native & Expo**: You'll start by creating a React Native app using Expo, a powerful framework that simplifies mobile app development. You'll dive into Expo Router for managing navigation with file-based routing, build dynamic pages for product categories, and manage cart functionality using Zustand, a lightweight state management library.
2. **Supabase**: This section introduces Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase. You'll learn to handle authentication, database management, and real-time updates. You'll implement secure user authentication, explore SQL functions, triggers, and set up row-level security for a secure back-end.
3. **Next.js for Admin Panel**: The admin panel is built using Next.js, known for its server-side rendering and API capabilities. You'll learn to manage categories and products, handle role-based access, and protect routes. The panel will allow you to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) efficiently on your platform’s data.
4. **Stripe for Payments**: This course will also guide you through integrating Stripe to handle payments securely. You’ll learn how to create Stripe customers, set up checkout sessions, and manage payments, all while keeping customer data safe.
5. **Push Notifications**: To enhance the user experience, you'll add real-time push notifications using EAS (Expo Application Services), ensuring your app can notify users of updates like order status changes in real time.
6. **Deployment**: Finally, you'll deploy your project to Vercel, ensuring your admin panel and the entire application are live and accessible. You'll also troubleshoot deployment fixes and ensure your app runs smoothly in production.

## Conclusion

By the end of this course, you'll have a fully functioning e-commerce mobile app with an admin panel, payment integration, real-time updates, and secure authentication. This project is an excellent addition to your portfolio, demonstrating your ability to handle complex, full-stack development.
