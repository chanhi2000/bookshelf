When working with Python, you may need to perform a tokenization operation on a given text dataset.

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller pieces, typically words or sentences, which are called tokens. These tokens can then be used for further analysis, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or natural language processing tasks.

In this article, we’ll discuss five different ways of tokenizing text in Python using some popular libraries and methods.

## How to Use the `split()` Method to Tokenize Text in Python

The `split()` Method is the most basic way to tokenize text in Python. You can use the `split()` method to split a string into a list based on a specified delimiter.

A delimiter is a simple character or symbol that is used to separate the pieces of text. For example: spaces(“ “), commas (`,`), hyphens (`-`) can be used as delimiters.

By default, if we do not specify a delimiter, then the split method uses spaces as a delimiter. If we do not specify a delimiter, it splits the text wherever there are spaces.

::: tip Example Code

```py
text = "Ayush and Anshu are a beautiful couple"
tokens = text.split()
print(tokens)
# 
# `['Ayush' , 'and' , 'Anshu' , 'are' , 'a',  'beautiful' , 'couple']`
```

:::

::: info Explanation

In the above example code, the string is broken into words whenever a space is found. Each word in the given text becomes a separate token.

## How to Use NLTK’s `word_tokenize()` Function to Tokenize Text in Python

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful library for NLP. You can use the `word_tokenize()` function to tokenize a string into words and punctuation marks. When we use `word_tokenize()` it recognizes punctuation as separate tokens, which is particularly useful when the meaning of the text could change depending on punctuation.

::: tip Example Code

```py
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt')
text = "Ayush and Anshu are a beautiful couple"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
#
# ['Ayush' , 'and' , 'Anshu' , 'are' , 'a', 'beautiful' , 'couple']`
```

:::

::: info Explanation

The text in the above code is tokenized into individual words. This method is different from other methods as it also treats punctuation, such as commas, question marks as separate tokens.

:::

::: tip Example Code with Punctuation

```py twoslash
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt')
text = "Ayush and Anshu aren't a beautiful couple"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
#
# ['Ayush', 'and', 'Anshu', 'are', 'a', 'beautiful', 'couple', ',', 'are', "n't", 'they', '?']
```

:::

::: info Explanation

In the above example, the apostrophe in “aren’t” will be handled separately.

:::

The above output shows why the word_tokenize() method is preferred in cases where punctuation is used. This method ensures the accurate separation of tokens.

## How to Use the `re.findall()` Method to Tokenize Text in Python

The `re` module allows you to define patterns to extract tokens. In Python, the `re.findall()` method allows us to extract tokens based on a pattern you define. For example, we can extract all words using the `\\w+` pattern. With `re.findall()`, you have complete control over how the text is tokenized.

::: tip Example Code

```py
import re

text = "Ayush and Anshu are a beautiful couple"
tokens = re.findall(r'\w+', text)
print(tokens)
#
# `['Ayush' , 'and' , 'Anshu' , 'are' , 'a', 'beautiful' , 'couple']`
```

:::

::: info Explanation

In the above code, `\w+` tells Python to find “word-like” sequences of characters. Punctuation is ignored, so only words are returned.

## How to Use `str.split()` In Pandas to Tokenize Text in Python

You can use Pandas to tokenize text in DataFrames. It provides an easy way of doing this. You can use the `str.split()` method to split strings into tokens. This method allows you to tokenize text in an entire column of a DataFrame, making it incredibly efficient for processing large amounts of text data at once.

::: tip Example Code

```py
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({"text": ["Ayush and Anshu are a beautiful couple"]})
df['tokens'] = df['text'].str.split()
print(df['tokens'][0])
# 
#  `['Ayush' , 'and' , 'Anshu' , 'are' , 'a' 'beautiful' , 'couple']`
```

:::

::: info Explanation

In the above code, the text column is split into tokens. This method is similar to Python’s basic `split()` method. This method is very helpful when we want to tokenize text in thousands of rows at once.

## How to Use Gensim’s `tokenize()` Function to Tokenize Text in Python

**Genism** is a popular library in Python that is used for topic modeling and text processing. It provides a simple way to tokenize text using the `tokenize()` function. This method is particularly useful when we are working with text data in the context of Gensim’s other functionalities, such as building word vectors or creating topic models.

::: tip Example Code

```py
from gensim.utils import tokenize

text = "Ayush and Anshu are a beautiful couple"
tokens = list(tokenize(text))
print(tokens)
#
# `['Ayush' , 'and' , 'Anshu' , 'are' , 'a' , 'beautiful' , 'couple']`
```

:::

::: info Explanation

In the above code, Gensim’s `tokenize()` function is used to break the text into individual words. It works similar to `split()`, but it is more powerful because it automatically removes punctuation and only keeps valid words. Since `tokenize()` returns an iterator, we use `list()` to convert it into a list of tokens.
