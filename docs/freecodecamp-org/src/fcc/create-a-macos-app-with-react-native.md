## Course Overview

This course, created by Brijen Makwana, provides a step-by-step guide to building a sophisticated MacOS app using React Native. You'll gain hands-on experience with essential tools and techniques, from setting up your development environment to implementing advanced features like AI-powered book summaries and state management.

Here are the key things you will learn:

- **Setup and Initialization**: Begin by setting up React Native on your Mac and initializing your project. You'll learn how to clean up the project structure to ensure a smooth development process.
- **Building Components**: Develop key components such as the SearchBar and BookItem, which are crucial for user interaction and displaying book information.
- **Integrating Google Books API**: Discover how to use Postman to test the Google Books API and integrate it into your project, enabling users to search and explore a vast library of books.
- **State Management with Tanstack Query and Zustand**: Learn how to manage application state efficiently using Tanstack Query and Zustand. You'll create custom hooks like useSearch and useBook to streamline data fetching and state updates.
- **Navigation and Routing**: Implement React Navigation to ensure smooth transitions between different screens in your app. You'll add routes for the Book Screen and Bookshelves Screen, enhancing the user experience.
- **AI-Powered Features**: Explore the integration of AI by setting up Google Generative AI and creating a custom hook, useAI, to generate book summaries. This feature adds a modern touch to your app, providing users with concise and insightful book overviews.
- **Local Storage and Book Management**: Implement local storage support to save user data and manage bookshelves effectively. You'll learn how to update and remove books using Zustand, ensuring a seamless user experience.
