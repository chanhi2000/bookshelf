This handbook will teach you the basics of TypeScript, including what it is, why it is useful, and the key features it offers.

TypeScript was created by Anders Hejlsberg, a prominent software engineer at Microsoft who’s also known for his work on C# and Delphi. TypeScript was designed to enhance JavaScript by adding static types, making it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.

We’ll start by using Vite to integrate TypeScript with a React project. Then you’ll learn about key concepts like type annotations, type inference, and how to handle objects and arrays.

After that, we’ll explore advanced topics such as union and any types, readonly properties, functions with specific parameter and return types, generics for flexible and reusable code, and the distinctive roles of type aliases and interfaces.

I’ll provide detailed examples and explanations throughout the handbook to give you a comprehensive understanding of how TypeScript's features can improve JavaScript development.

::: note Prerequisites

I assume you are already familiar with the fundamentals of JavaScript and React. So in this handbook, I won’t be going into in-depth explanations of certain concepts, such as the file structure when scaffolding projects.

## Conclusion

In this handbook, you got an in-depth overview of how you can use TypeScript basics in React. We discussed important concepts like type annotations, type inference, and managing objects and arrays, showing how TypeScript improves code stability and maintenance.

We also covered some advanced topics such as union and any types, readonly properties, and the use of generics, type aliases, and interfaces. I hope the examples helped you understand how TypeScript can enhance your JavaScript development, making TS a valuable tool for building robust, large-scale applications.
