Artificial Intelligence is changing how we build software, but it also introduces brand new security risks. If you're a developer or security professional stepping into the world of AI, how do you make sure your applications are safe?

We've just published a new course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel that will teach you how to build security into AI. The course was created by security expert Robert Herbig.

Here’s a quick look at what you'll learn:

- **AI vs. Traditional App Security:** Understand why securing an AI model isn't the same as securing a standard web app.
- **Threat Modeling for AI:** Learn how to identify potential weaknesses in your AI systems, from poisoned training data to supply chain attacks.
- **Input & Output Risks:** Dive into specific attack vectors like prompt injection and adversarial examples, and learn how to prevent sensitive data leaks.

As Robert says, "Security must be a foundational layer in AI development, not an afterthought."
