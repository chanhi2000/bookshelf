## What is Open Source?

Before we dive into how to contribute, let's clarify what "open-source" means. Open-source software is software that is made available with a license that allows anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code. This collaborative model allows anyone, from hobbyists to large corporations, to contribute to the project. Popular open-source projects include:

#### - *inux

The kernel that powers many operating systems.
#### - *ython

A widely used programming language.
#### - *eact

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
#### - *ozilla Firefox

A popular web browser.

These projects are typically maintained on platforms like GitHub and GitLab, where contributors can submit code, report issues, and review changes.

## How to Get Started with Open-Source Contributions

Getting started with open source can be broken down into several manageable steps. These steps will guide you through the entire process, from finding projects to contribute to, understanding how to make contributions, and submitting those contributions for review.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Before you can contribute to open-source projects, you need to set up your local development environment. The tools you'll need depend on the language or technology used in the project. Here's a basic setup that works for most projects:

#### 1. Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with others. You can install Git from [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-git"/>git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

![git-scm.com](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214111859/74f48b46-fee4-4bea-9c63-6ae24fdbf311.png)

After installing, set up your Git username and email:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

#### 2. GitHub Account

Most open-source projects are hosted on GitHub, so create an account at [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>github.com](https://github.com/).

![GitHub homepage](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214199999/142c4c47-8ed8-4fb8-a4ee-e57105ff35d4.png)

#### 3. Text Editor

Choose a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where you will write your code. Popular choices include [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-vscode"/>Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-subl"/>Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com/), and [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-jetbrains"/>JetBrains IDEs](https://jetbrains.com/).

![visual studio code](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214312343/e1062a2c-381d-41f0-b643-65ff82f01c88.png)

#### 4. Programming Language

Depending on the project, you'll need to install the necessary programming language. For example, if you're working on a Python project, make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Step 2: Understand Version Control with Git

Version control is the backbone of open-source contributions. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project without stepping on each other's toes. Before contributing, it’s important to understand the following Git concepts:

#### - *epository (repo)

A directory where the project’s code and files are stored.
#### - *orking

Forking a project creates a personal copy of the repository, which allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
#### - *lone

Cloning copies the entire repository to your local machine so you can work on it offline.
#### - *ranch

Branches are used to isolate your changes from the main codebase (usually called <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`main` or <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master`).
#### - *ull Request (PR)

A pull request is a proposal to merge your changes from your branch into the original repository’s codebase.

To clone a repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

To create a new branch for your changes:

```sh
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

### Step 3: Find a Project to Contribute To

Finding the right project is key to getting started. Here are some ways to find projects that are welcoming to beginners:

#### 1. GitHub Explore

GitHub has an [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>Explore](https://github.com/explore) page where you can find trending repositories or search for projects by language or interest.

![GitHub explore](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214628002/440e7fcc-8cb9-4bbb-8d2f-fd6505c4139f.png)

#### 2. Good First Issues

Many open-source projects label beginner-friendly issues with the tag "good first issue." You can find these by searching for "good first issue" on GitHub or other platforms.

![finding good first issues](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214567620/eee17260-2f94-455b-a925-60a8bec0cbc5.png)

#### 3. Open Source Communities

Websites like [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>First Timers Only](https://firsttimersonly.com/) and [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/) list open-source projects that are actively looking for beginner contributors.

![first timers only](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214482927/3de47afd-d9cf-440b-92eb-ff7abcfb2f3b.png)

#### 4. Check Documentation

Look for projects that have good documentation. Well-documented projects are more likely to guide you through the contribution process.

For example, if you're a Python developer, you could contribute to the Python documentation itself or libraries like `Requests`, `Flask`, or `Django`.

### Step 4: Understand the Project

Once you've found a project you're interested in, the next step is to familiarize yourself with it.

#### 1. Read the `README`

The `README` file of a project is the first place you should look. It provides an overview of the project, how to set it up, and often outlines the contribution guidelines.

![an example of README](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214859166/b762f2c2-ffde-43e8-8d6f-50697a2b6078.png)

#### 2. Check the Issues

Look at the issues in the project’s GitHub repository. Issues are often where bugs, feature requests, or tasks are tracked. Look for labels like `good first issue` or `beginner-friendly`.

![The issues tab on GitHub](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214763497/28f9dda5-8abb-45ef-aff9-dd3f2ab1f22d.png)

#### 3. Set Up the Project Locally

Clone the repository and set up the project on your local machine to make sure everything works as described in the README.

For example, if you are working on a Python project, you might need to install dependencies via `pip`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Read the Contribution Guidelines

Many projects have contribution guidelines. These guidelines might cover things like coding style, testing requirements, and how to format commit messages. Make sure you read and understand these guidelines.

![contribution guidelines](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733214985183/cb9921b7-c3eb-4ec4-bf6d-93083cdb416a.png)

### Step 5: Make Your First Contribution

Now comes the fun part, contributing! Here’s how to do it:

#### 1. Fork the Repository

On GitHub, click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the project.

![fork a repo](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733215091342/648dd025-f162-45dd-9edb-8d6fa8e7bff4.png)

#### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your fork to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
```

#### 3. Create a New Branch

It’s good practice to create a new branch for each contribution:

```sh
git checkout -b my-branch
```

#### 4. Make Changes

Now, make the changes you want to contribute. For example, if you’re fixing a bug, you can edit the code in the appropriate files. If you’re updating documentation, you can edit the <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-markdown"/>`README.md`.

Let’s say you’re fixing a typo in the README:

```md
# Incorrect text
This is a sampe of a typo.
```

You would change it to:

```md
# Corrected text
This is an example of a typo.
```

#### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you’ve made your changes, commit them with a clear, concise message:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in README"
```

#### 6. Push Your Changes

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```sh
git push origin my-branch
```

### Step 6: Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Now that your changes are pushed to GitHub, it’s time to submit them for review.

#### 1. Go to the Original Repository

Navigate to the original repository (not your fork).

![create a new pull request](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733215228523/f76e02bc-fd29-4416-a56e-c5c9232efe71.png)

#### 2. Create a Pull Request

GitHub will often display a banner suggesting that your branch is ready to create a pull request. Click the "Compare & pull request" button.

#### 3. Write a Description

Provide a clear description of what you’ve done and why. Be specific about what problem your changes solve.

Once the pull request is submitted, project maintainers will review your changes. They might ask for modifications or approve your changes.

### Step 7: Respond to Feedback

Maintainers may provide feedback on your pull request. Be sure to respond promptly. If they request changes, make those changes locally, commit them, and push them to your fork.

For example:

```sh
git commit --amend
git push --force
```

Once the changes are approved, your pull request will be merged into the main project.

## Non-Tech Open Source Contributions

While technical contributions such as coding are commonly associated with open-source projects, there are plenty of valuable ways to contribute that don’t require programming skills.

### 1. Documentation

Clear, comprehensive documentation is essential for any open-source project, but it’s often overlooked. As a non-technical contributor, you can improve or write documentation for a project, making it easier for new users and contributors to understand and use the software.

- Improving the `README`: Clarifying setup instructions, usage examples, and installation processes.
- Writing Tutorials: Creating step-by-step guides or video tutorials to help beginners get started with the project.
- Fixing Typos: Correcting spelling, grammar, and formatting errors in existing documentation.

### 2. Community Support and Engagement

Many open-source projects rely on a vibrant community to thrive. Contributing to the community can involve answering questions, managing discussions, and providing support to new users.

- Helping users who are facing problems with the project by answering their questions in GitHub issues or community forums.
- Ensuring discussions on forums, mailing lists, or social media are constructive and on-topic.
- Compiling frequently asked questions and their answers to assist users in resolving common issues.

### 3. Design and User Interface (UI) Contributions

Projects often need help making their user interface visually appealing and user-friendly. If you have a background in design, you can contribute by creating mockups, improving the layout, or suggesting UI/UX improvements.

- Designing logos, icons, or illustrations for the project.
- Creating wireframes or providing suggestions on how to make the interface more intuitive and easy to use.

### 4. Translating the Project

Making open-source projects accessible to a global audience is crucial. Translating the project’s content into different languages helps non-English speakers to use and contribute to the project.

- Converting project documentation into other languages to widen the user base.
- Adapting the software interface, error messages, or website to suit different regions and cultures.

### 5. Marketing and Outreach

Open-source projects need to be discovered by new users and contributors, which is where marketing comes in. Non-tech contributors can help raise awareness about the project through various channels.

- Sharing posts, updates, and highlights about the project on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other platforms.
- Writing about the project, how to use it, or how it solves specific problems.
- Making video tutorials or blog posts to teach new users how to use or contribute to the project.

### 6. Event Organization and Fundraising

Organizing events or raising funds can be vital for the sustainability of an open-source project. Non-tech contributions like event planning or financial support can make a big impact.

- Helping to organize community events, hackathons, or conferences to bring developers and users together.
- Assisting with fundraising efforts to secure the project’s financial future, whether through crowdfunding campaigns or grant applications.

### 7. Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing

While testing software might sound like a technical task, non-developers can help by testing usability and reporting issues. Non-technical users can provide valuable feedback on the project’s user experience.

- Identifying and reporting bugs or issues you encounter when using the software.
- Giving feedback on the software’s ease of use and suggesting improvements.

### 8. Legal and Licensing Contributions

Open-source projects often need help with legal aspects like licenses, terms of service, and ensuring the project complies with relevant laws.

- Ensuring the project is properly licensed and compliant with relevant open-source licenses.
- Assisting with the creation of contributor agreements or other legal documents that protect both the contributors and the project.

These non-tech contributions are essential for the success of open-source projects and are often overlooked by beginners who may feel that technical skills are the only way to contribute. The open-source community thrives on collaboration, and non-tech contributors play a significant role in fostering that spirit.

## Final thoughts

Contributing to open-source projects is a rewarding experience that can help you grow as a developer, connect with like-minded people, and make a difference in the world of software.

Remember, every contributor starts somewhere. Don’t be discouraged if your first contributions are small or if you encounter challenges along the way. The open-source community is welcoming, and the more you contribute, the more you'll learn and grow.
