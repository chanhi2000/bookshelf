Seven years ago, I began my journey into web development with HTML and CSS. As soon as I got the hang of JavaScript, I built my first website. The excitement was overwhelming, and I wanted to share it with my friends and the world.

Like many beginners, I started researching hosting platforms, only to find out about the cost of domains and hosting. That's when I discovered Git and GitHub, realizing I could share my projects without spending a dime.

If you're in the same boat, unsure about Git and GitHub and how to share your projects, this article is for you. It's the guide I wish I had seven years ago.

To demonstrate the power of Git and GitHub, we'll be using a real-world project as an example. Let's take the "IP Address Tracker application" project from [**this freeCodeCamp tutorial**](/freecodecamp.org/learn-rest-apis-javascript-project.md#practical-example-how-to-build-a-web-application-with-a-public-rest-api). You can download the source code for the project [here (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`iamspruce/ip-address-tracker`)](https://github.com/iamspruce/ip-address-tracker/).

If you've followed the tutorial and built the project, or if you have a project you'd like to share, this article is for you. We'll walk you through the steps to host your project on GitHub, making it accessible to the world.

::: note Audience

This guide is for beginner developers who have started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and want to learn how to share their projects using Git and GitHub.

:::

::: note Prerequisite Knowledge

Before diving in, ensure you are familiar with:

- Basic command-line operations.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
- A text editor like VS Code.

## Getting Started With Git and GitHub

I am not going to try to bore you with the differences between Git and GitHub. I am sure there are tons of resources in the world wide web already covering that but from a beginner's point of view, here is what they are:

### What is Git?

Git is a tool that helps you keep track of all the changes you make in your project's code. Imagine building a website about cats. If you change the website's title from "Cat Facts" to "All About Cats," Git will remember the change. If you later decide that you prefer "Cat Facts," Git lets you go back to that version easily.

It's like having a record of every edit, addition, and deletion you make to your project, so you can always revisit previous versions and make changes with confidence.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is like a cloud-based scrapbook for your code. It's an online record where you save every edit, addition, and deletion you make to your project, so you can access it from anywhere and share it with others.

Imagine having a digital filing cabinet where you can store and manage different versions of your website. You can invite friends to see and even help you with your project, making it easy to collaborate. GitHub tracks changes and keeps everything organized, so if something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous version.

## How to Set Up Git and GitHub

Now that we know what Git and GitHub are, let's get them set up on your computer. Follow these step-by-step instructions:

### How to Install Git on Windows

You can download the Git installer [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-git"/>here](https://git-scm.com/).

Run the installer and follow the setup instructions, keeping the default settings.

### How to Install Git on macOS

Open the Terminal on your Mac. You can find it in Applications > Utilities or use Spotlight to search for it.

Install Git using Homebrew by copying and pasting the following commands:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git
#
# ==> Downloading https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/tarballs/...
# ==> Installing git
# ==> Pouring git-2.43.0.mojave.bottle.tar.gz
# üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.30.1: 1,434 files, 43.8MB
```

### How to Install Git on Linux

Open Terminal on your Linux machine. Then use your distribution's package manager to install Git.

For example, on Ubuntu, copy and paste the following commands:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
#
# Reading package lists... Done
# Building dependency tree
# Reading state information... Done
# The following additional packages will be installed:
# git-man liberror-perl
# Suggested packages:
# git-daemon-run git-daemon-sysvinit git-doc git-el git-email git-gui gitk
# gitweb git-mediawiki git-arch git-cvs git-svn git-hg
# The following NEW packages will be installed:
# git git-man liberror-perl
# 0 upgraded, 3 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
# Need to get 7,841 kB of archives.
# After this operation, 43.8 MB of additional disk space will be used.
```

To verify the installation, open Terminal (if it's not already open) and type the following command to verify the installation:

```sh
git --version
#
# git version 2.43.0
```

You should see the installed Git version displayed.

### How to Create a GitHub Account

- Go to [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>GitHub](https://github.com/) and click on "Sign up."
- Follow the instructions to create your account, choose a username and password, and verify your email.
- Once your account is set up, customize your profile with a bio, profile picture, and links to your personal website or social media.

### How to Configure Git

Open Terminal and configure Git with the same username and email as your GitHub account:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

No output will be displayed, but Git will store your credentials for future use.

## How to Initialize a Git Repository

Now that you have Git and GitHub set up, let's start by initializing Git in a project. You can use any project of your choice or follow along with our example using the "IP Address Tracker" project.

### Step 1: Download and Open Your Project

Download the source code for your chosen project or use the "IP Address Tracker" project from [this link (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`iamspruce/ip-address-tracker`)](https://github.com/iamspruce/ip-address-tracker/). Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer. This will provide a concrete example to demonstrate Git concepts.

### Step 2: Open the Project in VS Code

Open Visual Studio Code and click on "File" > "Open Folder" to select the folder where you extracted the project.

### Step 3: Open the Terminal in VS Code

Click on "Terminal" > "New Terminal" to open the terminal in VS Code, where we'll interact with Git using commands.

### Step 4: Initialize a Git Repository

Initialize a Git repository by running the following command:

```sh
git init
#
# Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/spruceemmanuel/Documents/IP Address Tracker/.git/
```

This command creates a new hidden folder called <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git` in your project folder, which tracks changes to our project files. When you run `git init`, Git sets up the necessary files and directories to start versioning our project. This includes:

- A <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git` folder that stores all the metadata for your repository
- A <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`main` branch, which is the default branch for your repository
- A `HEAD` pointer, which points to the current branch (in this case, <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`main`).

By initializing a Git repository, you're telling Git to start tracking changes to your project files. This allows you to version your code, collaborate with others, and maintain a record of changes.

## How to Track Changes with Git

Now that we‚Äôve set up Git, it‚Äôs ready to keep track of changes in our project.

![VSCode source control](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-04-at-11.30.49-PM.png)

Git notices change in our files, but before we can save these changes, we need to tell Git to do so.

### Preparing Changes with git add

To get our changes ready to save, we use the `git add` command. Here‚Äôs how it works:

#### Adding Individual Files

If you want to add specific files, like index.html, script.js, or styles.css, you can use git add followed by the file name. For example:

```sh
git add index.html
```

#### Adding All Changes at Once

If you want to add all modified files in the project to the staging area, use:

```sh
git add .
```

### Saving Changes with git commit

Once we‚Äôve used git add, we use git commit to save our changes. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

```sh
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

Replace "Describe your changes here" with a brief description of what you‚Äôve changed. For example:

```sh
git commit -m "Update index.html with new content"
# 
# [master (root-commit) be9b1cd] Update index.html with new content
# 3 files changed, 386 insertions(+)
# create mode 100644 index.html
# create mode 100644 script.js
# create mode 100644 styles.css
```

By using `git add` and `git commit`, you‚Äôre instructing Git to track and save specific versions of your project. This helps you manage changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a record of your progress.

## How to Push Your Project to GitHub

Now that we have our changes tracked and committed locally, it‚Äôs time to upload our project to GitHub so we can share it with the world.

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

- Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
- Click the "+" icon in the upper-right corner and select "New repository."

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-04-at-11.36.23-PM.png)

- Fill out the repository name (for example: "ip-address-tracker"), and add a description if you like.
- Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.
- Do not initialize the repository with a <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-markdown"/>`README`, <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-git"/>`.gitignore`, or license (since we already have a local repository set up).
- Click "Create repository."

### Step 2: Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

To connect your local repository with the new GitHub repository, you need to add a remote origin. Follow these steps:

- Copy the URL of your new GitHub repository. It should look something like this: `https://github.com/yourusername/ip-address-tracker.git`
- Open Terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command:

```sh
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ip-address-tracker.git
```

### Step 3: Push Your Local Changes to GitHub

Now, push your local commits to the GitHub repository with:

```sh
git push -u origin main
#
# Enumerating objects: 8, done.
# Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
# Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
# Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 645 bytes | 645.00 KiB/s, done.
# Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
# To https://github.com/yourusername/ip-address-tracker.git
# * [new branch]      main -> main
# Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

### Step 4: Verify Your Repository on GitHub

Go back to your GitHub repository page. You should see all your files and commit history available online.

## How to Host Your Project on GitHub Pages

Now that your project has been initialized with Git and pushed to GitHub, let‚Äôs host it on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a free service that allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository.

### What are GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages turns your GitHub repository into a website. It's an easy way to showcase your projects without needing a separate hosting service. You can create static websites directly from your repositories.

### How to Enable GitHub Pages

- Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser.
- Click on the "Settings" tab.
- Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left-hand menu.
- Under "Source," select the branch you want to publish from (typically main or master), and choose the root folder.

![Selecting the branch and root folder for GitHub Pages.](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-04-at-11.12.19-PM.png)

- Click "Save."

### How to Get Your GitHub Pages URL

After enabling GitHub Pages, GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is published. It usually follows this format:

```http
https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>
```

![The URL where your GitHub Pages site is published.](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-04-at-11.19.05-PM.png)

Open your browser and paste the URL to see your live website.

### How to Update Your GitHub Pages Site

Every time you push changes to the selected branch in your repository, GitHub Pages will automatically update your live site. Here‚Äôs a quick reminder on how to push changes:

- Make changes to your project files.
- Add and commit your changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

- Push the changes to GitHub:

```sh
git push origin main
```

With these steps, you‚Äôve successfully hosted your project on GitHub Pages. Congratulations! Your project is now live and accessible to the world.
