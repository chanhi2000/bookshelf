In this handbook, you learned how to implement scalable access control using both CASL and a custom solution. We started by diving into different access control models, focusing on ABAC, and explored two ways to enforce ABAC-based rules.

With CASL, you saw how easy it is to define user abilities, whether you’re using a shared library or external permissions. We walked through how to set up access control for various user actions, all with clean, readable code. You also learned how to add advanced features like dynamic conditions and field-level access for even more granular control.

On the other hand, you also learned how to build a custom permission framework tailored to your app’s specific needs. You combined contextual state-based checks with policy-based rules, creating a flexible and scalable access control system. Along the way, you explored concepts like Policy as Code, CEL (Common Expression Language), custom hooks, caching, and conditional fetching using RTK queries. You also saw how to enforce access control on components, protected routes, and more.

Both approaches share some key benefits:

- **Dynamic and scalable**: Adding new actions or entities is as simple as updating a single file - no code rewrites required.
- **Separation of concerns**: Keeps validation logic separate from UI components, which makes your code easier to maintain.
- **Readable**: You can define permissions using simple, conversational language like "*Can I read this post?*" or "*Can I create a comment?*"
- **Reusable components**: You can reuse wrapper components and hooks across your app to reduce duplication.
- **State reactivity**: Works seamlessly with React state, ensuring that your access control rules are reflected dynamically in your UI.

## Further Scaling Considerations

If your policy payload is cumbersome or validation logic is computationally expensive, consider the following optimizations:

- **Memoize the output**: Use `useMemo` to cache the result of expensive computations, but be mindful that `useMemo` itself can be costly if overused.
- **Modularize policies**: Break down your policies into separate files based on their domain. Fetch only the essential policies at startup and lazy load non-essential ones on demand.
- **Offload validation to the backend**: Move policy validation logic to the backend and consider server-side rendering. But, keep in mind that some dynamic checks still need to occur on the frontend.

Don’t forget to implement access control on the back-end too and make sure to filter-out sensitive data before sending it to the client!
