You’ve built toy projects. Now build something real.

We've just launched a new course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a production-grade AI project from the ground up. Created by the Ayush Singh, this course is a deep dive into building a real-world system.

Instead of focusing on a single model's performance, this course teaches you to build an entire AI factory. You'll learn to create a robust pipeline that can ingest live data using a professional web scraping API to pull content directly from any website. A specialized pipeline then cleans and segments raw documents into chunks that are optimized for AI models. You will build a data factory that can produce training data for various applications like chatbots and summarization tools. To ensure quality, a built-in quality control lab evaluates the data for issues like toxicity and bias, and the course shows you how to export your completed dataset in common formats like JSON and CSV, complete with metadata and quality scores.

Ayush uses a clever factory analogy to explain the project's design, making complex concepts easy to understand. You'll learn essential software engineering practices that are critical for real-world applications.

The course demonstrates how to organize your code with a modular design using managers, clients, and blueprints for a scalable and maintainable project. You'll also see how to build efficient, asynchronous data pipelines that can handle multiple tasks at once without slowing down. The system even includes a smart fallback mechanism and logging to manage issues gracefully, so your process never completely fails, and you'll learn how to track token usage and costs, a crucial skill for any project that relies on external APIs.

Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/mvleESOUTRw) (2-hour watch).
