While magic methods are powerful, they can impact performance if you don’t use them carefully. Let's explore some common performance considerations and how to measure them.

---

## Impact of Magic Methods on Performance

Different magic methods have different performance implications:

### Attribute Access methods

- `__getattr__`, `__getattribute__`, `__setattr__`, and `__delattr__` are called frequently
- Complex operations in these methods can significantly slow down your code

### Container methods

- `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, and `__len__` are called often in loops
- Inefficient implementations can make your container much slower than built-in types

### Operator overloading

- Arithmetic and comparison operators are used frequently
- Complex implementations can make simple operations unexpectedly slow

Let's measure the performance impact of `__getattr__` vs. direct attribute access:

```py :collapsed-lines
import time

class DirectAccess:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 42

class GetAttrAccess:
    def __init__(self):
        self._value = 42

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if name == "value":
            return self._value
        raise AttributeError(f"'{self.__class__.__name__}' object has no attribute '{name}'")

# Measure performance
direct = DirectAccess()
getattr_obj = GetAttrAccess()

def benchmark(obj, iterations=1000000):
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(iterations):
        x = obj.value
    end = time.time()
    return end - start

direct_time = benchmark(direct)
getattr_time = benchmark(getattr_obj)

print(f"Direct access: {direct_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"__getattr__ access: {getattr_time:.6f} seconds")
print(f"__getattr__ is {getattr_time / direct_time:.2f}x slower")
```

Running this benchmark shows significant performance differences:

```plaintext
Direct access: 0.027714 seconds
__getattr__ access: 0.060646 seconds
__getattr__ is 2.19x slower
```

As you can see, using `__getattr__` is more than twice as slow as direct attribute access. This might not matter for occasionally accessed attributes, but it can become significant in performance-critical code that accesses attributes in tight loops.

## Optimization Strategies

Fortunately, there are various ways you can optimize magic methods.

1. **Use slots for memory efficiency**: This reduces memory usage and improves attribute access speed. It’s best for classes with many instances.
2. **Cache computed values**: You can store results of expensive operations and update the cache only when necessary. Use `@property` for computed attributes.
3. **Minimize method calls**: Make sure you avoid unnecessary magic method calls and use direct attribute access when possible. Consider using `__slots__` for frequently accessed attributes.
