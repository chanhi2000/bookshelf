Postman is a platform used by developers, API testers, technical writers and DevOps teams for testing, documenting and collaborating on API development. It provides a user-friendly interface for making different types of API requests (HTTP, GraphQL, gRPC), inspecting responses, and organizing API calls into collections for collaboration and automation.

Performing repetitive tasks while testing APIs is stressful and time-wasting. For example, the process of retrieving, copying and pasting new authentication tokens for use in Postman is repetitive. You can simplify this process by using Postman scripts to store auth tokens and then reuse them without repeating the copy and paste steps.

To practice along with this guide, you should have:

- The [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-postman"/>Postman API client](https://postman.com/downloads/) installed on your computer
- Experience in making API requests with Postman
- A backend application that uses JWT authentication and has its documentation in your Postman client

::: note

If you don’t have a backend application setup, I created one that you can clone from GitHub at [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`orimdominic/freeCodeCamp-postman-api-jwt`](https://github.com/orimdominic/freeCodeCamp-postman-api-jwt).

:::

By the end of this article, you should be able to simplify the process of obtaining and reusing authentication tokens across your API requests. You should also have a practical understanding of some scripts necessary for use in other areas of software testing with Postman.

## What are Postman Scripts?

[<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-postman"/>Postman scripts](https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/tests-and-scripts/) are blocks of JavaScript code that you can write and run within the Postman API client to automate and enhance API testing workflows. You can use Postman scripts to add code to run before and after API requests. These scripts can be used to:

- Add logic and process data from API requests
- Write test assertions for API responses
- Run automated tests on API endpoints

![The Postman scripts tab](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756577771526/161bd327-fbf7-48cb-acab-317ab1cad4c5.jpeg)

You can find Postman scripts under the **Scripts** tab of an API request. Code written in the **Pre-request** tab runs before the request is made and code written in the **Post-response** tab runs after the response is made.

## How to Simplify Your JWT Authentication Process

In summary, you will carry out the following steps to achieve the objective of this tutorial:

1. Authenticate to get the token
2. Save the token in a collection variable with Postman scripts
3. Use the variable in an API request

### Authenticate to Get the Token

To get started, carry out the following steps:

1. Start your backend application and make sure it is running successfully.
2. Open up your Postman application and go to the API request for signing in to get a JWT.
3. Make an API request to the sign in endpoint and take note of the JSON response schema.

![Authentication request response](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756573137191/b5aad14c-5094-4a84-8876-1bbbb869064c.jpeg)

The highlighted part of the image above shows the JSON response from a successful sign in request. In the response schema, the auth token to be used for authorization is in the `data.token` field. You will use Postman scripts to store this token in a variable and then use the variable in the `Authorization` header of requests that require authorization.

### How to Save the Token in a Variable with a Postman Script

![Add logic in Post-response Postman script](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756575948975/2b43493d-2803-45cd-aefe-0ca5694f75e8.jpeg)

In Postman, click on the **Scripts** tab next to the **Body** tab. If the Postman application window is small, you may need to click a dropdown to see it. Next, click on the **Post-response** tab. In the text area to the right, you will write the script to capture the auth token from the response and store it in a Postman variable. Copy the JavaScript code below and paste it into the text area.

```js
if (pm.response.code == 200) {
  const token = pm.response.json().data.token
  pm.collectionVariables.set("auth_token", token)
}
```

Postman scripts use the [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-postman"/>`pm` identifier](https://learning.postman.com/docs/tests-and-scripts/write-scripts/postman-sandbox-api-reference/) to access and modify information in the Postman environment. The script above uses `pm` to first ensure that the request was successful by checking if the response status code is `200`.

Inside the conditional statement, `pm.response.json().data.token` is used to get the authentication token from the JSON response and store it in a collection variable called `auth_token`. If `auth_token` doesn’t exist already, it is created and its value is set to the value of `token`. If it exists already, its value is replaced.

![Postman collection variable set by a script](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756581970294/bed1fe89-9c00-4b94-9f71-173ea3bf1cd1.png)

To confirm that `auth_token` has been set, click on the name of the collection (labelled 1 in the screenshot above) and then click on the **Variables** tab (labelled 2 in the screenshot above). Next, instead of repeatedly copying the token and pasting it in the `Authorization` header of your requests, you will use `auth_token` in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

### How to Use the Variable in a Request

![Use the Variable in a Request](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1756583915681/d3bf0f56-c406-4d3e-b7f1-df4cbc2a3cfc.png)

Reference the collection variable in the `Authorization` header by surrounding it with double curly braces `{{auth_token}}`. When you make an API request, Postman will use the value referenced by `{{auth_token}}` as the `Authorization` header.

If another authentication request causes the value of `auth_token` to be updated, you no longer need to copy the new auth token. The script in the post-response tab will update the `auth_token` value and you can go on with making API requests smoothly. No need for repeatedly copying and pasting - **Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)**.
