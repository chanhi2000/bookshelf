Ruby is a programming language designed with developer happiness in mind. Its elegant and intuitive syntax makes coding not only productive but also enjoyable. Ruby stands out with its powerful metaprogramming capabilities, allowing developers to treat code as data and manipulate it at runtime.

While many modern languages offer similar features, Ruby consistently delivers a seamless and joyful experience. Whether you're building a startup MVP, a scalable enterprise application, or a lightweight API, Ruby has you covered with frameworks like [<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-rails"/>Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/).

Despite the growing popularity of JavaScript and Python, Ruby remains a valuable language to learn, not just for its utility, but for how it teaches you to write clean, expressive, and maintainable code.

If you've heard of Ruby but never used it, this tutorial is the perfect starting point. Designed to be completed in an afternoon, it offers a glimpse into what makes Ruby so beloved by developers. While it doesn't cover every aspect of the language, Ruby's intuitive nature ensures you'll be well prepared to dive right into frameworks like Sinatra or Rails after completing it.

## Code Playbacks

Code playbacks are a unique way to learn about programming. They are guided walkthroughs of code, allowing you to see not just the code itself but also the thought process behind it. This approach helps you understand not only what the code does, but *why* it was written that way. Here is a short video to show how to move through a code playback:

By registering on [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Playback Press](https://playbackpress.com/books), you’ll gain access to an AI assistant that can answer your questions about the code. This makes learning even more interactive and personalized. Watch this video to see how to work with it:
