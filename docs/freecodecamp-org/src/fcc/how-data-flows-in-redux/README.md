## What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, primarily used with libraries like React. It helps manage the application state in a centralized store, making it easier to manage and update state across your entire application.

In simple terms, Redux provides a way to store and manage the data that your application needs to work. It follows a strict pattern to ensure that state changes are predictable and manageable.

::: info Why Use Redux for Data Management?

Using Redux for data management in your application offers several advantages:

- **Centralized State Management**: Redux stores the application's state in a single store, making it easier to manage and debug compared to having scattered state across multiple components.
- **Predictable State Changes**: State mutations are done through reducers, which are pure functions. This ensures that state changes are predictable and traceable, making it easier to understand how data flows through your application.
- **Easier Debugging**: With a single source of truth, debugging becomes simpler. You can log state changes, track actions, and even implement time-travel debugging (via Redux DevTools) to replay actions and inspect state at any point in time.
- **Facilitates Testing**: Since reducers are pure functions that depend only on their input and produce predictable output, testing becomes straightforward. You can easily test how reducers update the state in response to different actions.
- **Enforces Unidirectional Data Flow**: Redux follows a strict unidirectional data flow pattern. Data flows in one direction: actions are dispatched, reducers update the state immutably, and components subscribe to the changes they're interested in. This pattern simplifies data management and reduces bugs related to inconsistent state.
- **Eases State Persistence**: Redux makes it easier to persist your application state across sessions or store it locally, enhancing the user experience by preserving data between visits.
- **Scalability**: Redux scales well with large applications because of its centralized state management. As your application grows, managing state becomes more manageable and less error-prone compared to using local component state or prop drilling.

## Core Concepts of Redux Data Flow

Understanding the core concepts of Redux data flow is essential for mastering state management in modern JavaScript applications.

### Unidirectional Data Flow

Redux follows a strict unidirectional data flow pattern, which means that data in your application moves in a single direction through a series of steps:

1. **Actions**: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. They are the only source of information for the store.
2. **Reducers**: Reducers are pure functions responsible for handling state transitions based on actions. They specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
3. **Store**: The store holds the application state. It allows access to the state via `getState()`, updates the state via `dispatch(action)`, and registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`.
4. **View**: React components (or any other UI layer) subscribe to the store to receive updates when the state changes. They then re-render based on the updated state.

Here’s a simplified overview of how the unidirectional data flow works in Redux:

1. **Action Dispatch**: Components dispatch actions to the Redux store using `store.dispatch(action)`. Actions are plain JavaScript objects with a `type` field that describes the type of action being performed.
2. **Action Handling**: The store passes the dispatched action to the root reducer. The reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and the action, computes the new state based on the action, and returns the updated state.
3. **State Update**: The Redux store updates its state based on the return value of the root reducer. It notifies all subscribed components of the state change.
4. **Component Re-render**: Components that are subscribed to the store receive the updated state as props. They re-render with the new data.

::: info Benefits of Unidirectional Data Flow

- **Predictability**: By enforcing a single direction for data flow, Redux makes state changes more predictable and easier to understand. Actions are explicit about what changes are happening, and reducers clearly define how the state transitions occur.
- **Debugging**: Unidirectional data flow simplifies debugging because you can trace how state changes propagate through your application. Redux DevTools enhance this further by allowing you to track actions, inspect state changes over time, and even replay actions to reproduce bugs.
- **Maintainability**: With a clear separation between data (state) and logic (reducers), Redux promotes cleaner, more maintainable code. It reduces the likelihood of bugs caused by inconsistent state mutations or side effects.
- **Scalability**: As your application grows in size and complexity, unidirectional data flow helps manage state updates more effectively. It avoids the pitfalls of two-way data binding and ensures that changes to the state are controlled and manageable.
- **Testing**: Since reducers are pure functions that take inputs and produce outputs without side effects, unit testing becomes straightforward. You can test reducers with different actions and state scenarios to ensure they behave as expected.

## State Management with Redux Store

State management plays a pivotal role in modern web development, ensuring applications maintain consistent and predictable states across various components.

### What is the Redux Store?

The Redux Store is the heart of Redux state management. It holds the entire state tree of your application. The store allows you to:

- Access the current state of your application via `store.getState()`.
- Dispatch actions to change the state using `store.dispatch(action)`.
- Subscribe to changes in the state so your components can update accordingly using `store.subscribe(listener)`.

In essence, the Redux Store acts as a centralized repository for the state of your application, facilitating predictable data flow and making state management more manageable.

### Store Structure (State, Reducers, Actions)

The **state** in Redux represents the entire state of your application. It is typically structured as a plain JavaScript object. The shape of the state is defined by the reducers. For example:

```js
const initialState = {
  todos: [],
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',
};
```

In this example, `todos` and `visibilityFilter` are pieces of state managed by Redux.

**Reducers** are functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions dispatched to the store. They take the current state and an action as arguments, and return the new state based on the action type.

Reducers must be pure functions, meaning they produce the same output for the same input and do not modify the state directly.

```js
const todosReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ];
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(todo =>
        (todo.id === action.id)
          ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
          : todo
      );
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

In this example, `todosReducer` manages the `todos` piece of state, handling actions like `'ADD_TODO'` and `'TOGGLE_TODO'` to add new todos or toggle their completion status.

**Actions** are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in your application. They are the only source of information for the store. Actions typically have a `type` field that indicates the type of action being performed, and they may also carry additional data necessary for the action.

```js
const addTodo = (text) => ({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: nextTodoId++,
  text
});

const toggleTodo = (id) => ({
  type: 'TOGGLE_TODO',
  id
});
```

In this example, `addTodo` and `toggleTodo` are action creator functions that return actions to add a new todo and toggle the completion status of a todo, respectively.

The relationship between these elements in Redux is crucial for managing application state effectively:

- **Actions** describe events that occur in your application.
- **Reducers** specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.
- **Store** holds the application state and allows you to dispatch actions to update the state.

Together, these components form the core structure of Redux state management, providing a clear and predictable way to manage and update application state across your entire application.

---

## Actions: Initiating State Changes

Managing state effectively lies at the core of creating dynamic and responsive applications. Actions, within the Redux architecture and similar state management libraries, serve as important elements for initiating state changes.

### Action Creators (Functions to Create Actions)

Action creators in Redux are functions that create and return action objects. These action objects describe what happened in your application and are dispatched to the Redux store to initiate state changes.

Action creators encapsulate the logic of creating actions, making your code more modular and easier to test.

Here's an example of an action creator:

```js
// Action creator function
const addTodo = (text) => ({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: nextTodoId++,
  text
});

// Usage of the action creator
const newTodoAction = addTodo('Buy groceries');
```

In this example:

- `addTodo` is an action creator function that takes `text` as a parameter and returns an action object.
- The action object has a `type` field (`'ADD_TODO'`) that identifies the type of action and additional fields (`id` and `text`) that provide necessary data for the action.

Action creators simplify the process of creating actions, especially when actions require complex data or calculations before dispatching.

### Action Types (Identifying Different Actions)

Action types in Redux are string constants that define the type of action being performed. They are used to identify and differentiate different actions that can be dispatched to the Redux store. By using string constants for action types, Redux ensures that action types are unique and easy to reference throughout your application.

Here's how action types are typically defined:

```js
// Action types as constants
const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';
const TOGGLE_TODO = 'TOGGLE_TODO';
const SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER = 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER';
```

These constants (`ADD_TODO`, `TOGGLE_TODO`, `SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER`) represent different actions that can occur in your application, such as adding a todo, toggling the completion status of a todo, or setting a visibility filter for todos.

Action types are typically used in action objects created by action creators and are matched in reducers to determine how the state should change in response to each action.

```js
// Example of using action types in a reducer
const todosReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ];
    case TOGGLE_TODO:
      return state.map(todo =>
        (todo.id === action.id)
          ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
          : todo
      );
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

In this example:

- `ADD_TODO` and `TOGGLE_TODO` are action types used in the `todosReducer` to handle different types of actions (`'ADD_TODO'` and `'TOGGLE_TODO'`).
- The `action.type` field in the switch statement ensures that the reducer responds appropriately to each dispatched action based on its type.

---

## How to Process State Changes

At the heart of state management are reducers, pure functions designed to handle state transitions in a controlled and immutable manner.

### Pure Functions: Reducers at the Core

Reducers in Redux are pure functions responsible for specifying how the application's state changes in response to actions dispatched to the store. They take the current state and an action as arguments, and return the new state based on the action type.

Here’s a breakdown of how reducers work and their role in managing state changes:

#### Pure Functions

Reducers are pure functions, which means they:

- Produce the same output for the same input every time they are called.
- Do not cause any side effects (such as modifying arguments or global variables).
- Do not mutate the state directly, but instead return a new state object.

#### Handling State Transitions

Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to different types of actions. They use the current state and the action dispatched to compute and return the new state.

```js
// Example of a todos reducer
const todosReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ];
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(todo =>
        (todo.id === action.id)
          ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
          : todo
      );
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

In this example:

- `todosReducer` is a pure function that takes `state` (current todos array) and `action` as arguments.
- Depending on the `action.type`, it computes and returns a new state (updated todos array).

#### Immutable State Updates

Reducers should never mutate the state directly. Instead, they create copies of the state and modify the copies to produce a new state object. This ensures that Redux can detect state changes and update components efficiently.

#### Single Responsibility Principle

Each reducer typically handles updates to a specific slice of the application state. This helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and makes reducers easier to understand, test, and maintain.

::: info Characteristics of Pure Functions

Pure functions, including Redux reducers, have specific characteristics that make them well-suited for managing state changes:

- **Deterministic**: A pure function always produces the same output for the same input. This predictability ensures that reducers behave consistently and are easier to reason about.
- **No Side Effects**: Pure functions do not modify the input arguments or any external state. They only depend on their input parameters and produce an output without causing observable side effects.
- **Immutable Data**: Pure functions do not mutate data. Instead, they create and return new data structures. In Redux, reducers produce a new state object without modifying the existing state, enabling efficient change detection and state management.
- **Referential Transparency**: Pure functions can be replaced with their return values without affecting the correctness of the program. This property supports composability and makes it easier to test and reason about code.

## Anatomy of a Reducer Function

A reducer function, at its core, defines how application state changes in response to dispatched actions. This function takes two parameters: the current state and an action object, determining the new state based on the type of action received.

### Parameters: Previous State and Action Object

A reducer function in Redux is a pure function that takes two parameters: the previous state (state before the action is applied) and an action object. These parameters define how the reducer computes the next state of the application.

#### Previous State

This parameter represents the current state of the application before the action is dispatched. It is immutable and should not be modified directly within the reducer.

#### Action Object

An action object is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened in your application. It typically has a `type` field that indicates the type of action being performed. Other fields in the action object may provide additional data necessary to update the state.

```js
const action = {
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  id: 1,
  text: 'Buy groceries'
};
```

In this example, `action.type` is `'ADD_TODO'`, indicating that we want to add a new todo item to the state.

### Return Value: Updated State

The reducer function must return the updated state based on the previous state and the action object passed to it. The updated state is typically a new object that represents the application's state after applying the action.

Here’s the basic structure of a reducer function:

```js :collapsed-lines
const initialState = {
  todos: [],
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL'
};

const todoAppReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          {
            id: action.id,
            text: action.text,
            completed: false
          }
        ]
      };
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: state.todos.map(todo =>
          (todo.id === action.id)
            ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
            : todo
        )
      };
    case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':
      return {
        ...state,
        visibilityFilter: action.filter
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

In this example:

- `todoAppReducer` is a reducer function that manages the state of todos and visibility filters.
- It takes `state` (previous state) and `action` as parameters.
- Depending on the `action.type`, it computes and returns a new state object that reflects the changes caused by the action.

::: info Key Points

- **Immutable Update**: Reducers should never modify the previous state directly. Instead, they create a new state object by copying the previous state (`...state`) and applying changes to it.
- **Default Case**: The `default` case in the `switch` statement returns the current state unchanged if the reducer doesn’t recognize the action type. This ensures that the reducer always returns a valid state object, even if no changes are made.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each case in the `switch` statement corresponds to a specific action type and is responsible for updating a specific slice of the application state. This promotes a clear separation of concerns and makes reducers easier to understand and maintain.

:::

## How to Handle Different Actions in Reducers

In Redux, you can handle different actions in reducers using either switch statements or conditional logic. Both approaches aim to determine how the application state should change based on the type of action dispatched.

### Using Switch Statements

Switch statements are commonly used in Redux reducers to handle different action types. Each `case` in the switch statement corresponds to a specific action type, and the reducer executes the corresponding logic based on the action type.

Here's an example of using switch statements in a reducer:

```js :collapsed-lines
const initialState = {
  todos: [],
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL'
};

const todoAppReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          {
            id: action.id,
            text: action.text,
            completed: false
          }
        ]
      };
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: state.todos.map(todo =>
          (todo.id === action.id)
            ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
            : todo
        )
      };
    case 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER':
      return {
        ...state,
        visibilityFilter: action.filter
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

In this example:

- The `todoAppReducer` function uses a switch statement to handle different action types (`'ADD_TODO'`, `'TOGGLE_TODO'`, `'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'`).
- Each `case` block specifies how the state should be updated in response to the corresponding action type.
- The `default` case returns the current state unchanged if the reducer doesn’t recognize the action type, ensuring that the reducer always returns a valid state object.

### Using Conditional Logic

Alternatively, reducers can also use conditional logic (if-else statements) to determine how to update the state based on the action type. While less common than switch statements in Redux, conditional logic can be used similarly to handle actions.

Here's an example of using conditional logic in a reducer:

```js :collapsed-lines
const todoAppReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  if (action.type === 'ADD_TODO') {
    return {
      ...state,
      todos: [
        ...state.todos,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ]
    };
  } else if (action.type === 'TOGGLE_TODO') {
    return {
      ...state,
      todos: state.todos.map(todo =>
        (todo.id === action.id)
          ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed }
          : todo
      )
    };
  } else if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {
    return {
      ...state,
      visibilityFilter: action.filter
    };
  } else {
    return state;
  }
};
```

In this example:

- The `todoAppReducer` function uses if-else statements to check the action type (`action.type`) and execute different logic based on the type of action.
- Each condition specifies how the state should be updated for the corresponding action type.
- The final `else` block returns the current state unchanged if the action type is not recognized.

### Choosing Between Switch Statements and Conditional Logic

#### 1. Switch Statements

- Advantages: Switch statements are typically more readable and maintainable when handling multiple action types in Redux reducers. They clearly separate different cases based on action types.
- Considerations: Ensure each action type has a corresponding `case` in the switch statement to handle updates correctly.

#### 2. Conditional Logic

- Advantages: Conditional logic (if-else statements) provides flexibility and can be easier to understand in certain scenarios where there are fewer action types.
- Considerations: Maintain consistency in handling action types and ensure each condition handles state updates correctly.

In practice, switch statements are the recommended approach in Redux reducers due to their clarity and convention within the Redux community. They help maintain a structured approach to managing state changes based on different action types, promoting consistency and predictability in Redux applications.

## Dispatching Actions: How to Update the Redux Store

Dispatching actions in Redux is fundamental to managing state updates within your application. Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, relies on actions as payloads of information that send data from your application to the Redux store.

### The `dispatch` function

In Redux, the `dispatch` function is a method provided by the Redux store. It is used to dispatch actions to trigger state changes in the application. When an action is dispatched, the Redux store calls the reducer function associated with it, computes the new state, and notifies all subscribers that the state has been updated.

Here's how you use the `dispatch` function:

```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';

// Reducer function
const counterReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Create Redux store
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Dispatch actions to update state
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
```

In this example:

- We create a Redux store using `createStore` and pass in the `counterReducer` function.
- The `store.dispatch` function is used to dispatch actions (`{ type: 'INCREMENT' }` and `{ type: 'DECREMENT' }`) to update the state.
- Each dispatched action triggers the corresponding case in the reducer, updating the state as defined.

### Dispatching Actions from Components or Events

In a typical Redux application, actions are often dispatched from React components in response to user interactions or other events.

To dispatch actions from components, you typically connect the component to the Redux store using React Redux's `connect` function or hooks like `useDispatch`.

Here's how you can dispatch actions from a React component using `connect` and `mapDispatchToProps`:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

// Action creator functions
const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
const decrement = () => ({ type: 'DECREMENT' });

// Component definition
const Counter = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => (
  <div>
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
    <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
  </div>
);

// Map state to props
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  count: state.count
});

// Map dispatch to props
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  increment,
  decrement
};

// Connect component to Redux store
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

In this example:

- `increment` and `decrement` are action creator functions that return actions (`{ type: 'INCREMENT' }` and `{ type: 'DECREMENT' }`).
- The `Counter` component is connected to the Redux store using `connect`. It receives `count` from the Redux state as a prop, along with `increment` and `decrement` action creators.
- Clicking the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons dispatches actions, which are handled by the reducer to update the Redux state.

Alternatively, you can use React Redux hooks (`useDispatch`) for dispatching actions in functional components:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  };

  const handleDecrement = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={handleDecrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

In this functional component example:

- `useSelector` is used to select `count` from the Redux store state.
- `useDispatch` is used to get the `dispatch` function from the Redux store.
- `handleIncrement` and `handleDecrement` functions dispatch actions (`{ type: 'INCREMENT' }` and `{ type: 'DECREMENT' }`) to update the Redux state when the buttons are clicked.

## How to Access Specific Data from the Store

Accessing specific data from the store in Redux involves navigating through the application's state structure to retrieve precise information needed for rendering components or performing logic.

### Creating Selector Functions

Selectors in Redux are functions that encapsulate the logic for retrieving specific pieces of data from the Redux store state. They help to decouple the components from the structure of the state and facilitate efficient data access and transformation.

Here’s how you can create selector functions:

```js
// Example Redux state
const initialState = {
  todos: [
    { id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux', completed: false },
    { id: 2, text: 'Write Redux selectors', completed: true },
    // more todos...
  ],
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
};

// Selector function to get todos from state
const getTodos = (state) => state.todos;

// Selector function to filter todos based on visibility filter
const getVisibleTodos = (state) => {
  const todos = getTodos(state);
  const visibilityFilter = state.visibilityFilter;

  switch (visibilityFilter) {
    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
      return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed);
    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
      return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
    case 'SHOW_ALL':
    default:
      return todos;
  }
};
```

In this example:

- `getTodos` is a selector function that retrieves the `todos` array from the Redux state.
- `getVisibleTodos` is a selector function that filters `todos` based on the `visibilityFilter` stored in the state.

Selectors can also be composed to create more complex selectors:

```js
// Composed selector function to get visible todos
const getVisibleTodos = (state) => {
  const todos = getTodos(state);
  const visibilityFilter = state.visibilityFilter;

  switch (visibilityFilter) {
    case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
      return getCompletedTodos(todos);
    case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
      return getActiveTodos(todos);
    case 'SHOW_ALL':
    default:
      return todos;
  }
};

// Helper functions for filtering todos
const getCompletedTodos = (todos) => todos.filter(todo => todo.completed);
const getActiveTodos = (todos) => todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
```

### Memoization for Efficient Selector Usage

Memoization is a technique used to optimize expensive computations by caching the results of function calls based on their input. In the context of Redux selectors, memoization can improve performance by ensuring that selectors only recalculate their results when their input (state) changes.

You can use libraries like `reselect` for memoization in Redux selectors:

```sh
npm install reselect
```

::: tip Example usage of `reselect` for memoization

```js
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

// Selectors
const getTodos = (state) => state.todos;
const getVisibilityFilter = (state) => state.visibilityFilter;

// Memoized selector to get visible todos
const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(
  [getTodos, getVisibilityFilter],
  (todos, visibilityFilter) => {
    switch (visibilityFilter) {
      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
        return todos.filter(todo => todo.completed);
      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
        return todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed);
      case 'SHOW_ALL':
      default:
        return todos;
    }
  }
);
```

In this example:

- `createSelector` from `reselect` creates a memoized selector that takes `getTodos` and `getVisibilityFilter` as input selectors.
- The selector function computes the filtered todos based on the `visibilityFilter` and caches the result until the input selectors change.

## How to Connect React Components to Redux

Connecting React components to Redux is a fundamental technique for managing application state efficiently within React-based projects. Redux serves as a centralized store that holds the entire state of your application, making it accessible to any component that needs it.

### The `connect` Function from react-redux Library

In React applications using Redux for state management, the `connect` function from the `react-redux` library is used to connect React components to the Redux store. It provides a way to inject Redux state and action dispatching functions (dispatchers) into your components.

Here’s how you use `connect`:

```jsx :collapsed-lines
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

// Define a React component
const Counter = ({ count, increment, decrement }) => (
  <div>
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
    <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
  </div>
);

// Map Redux state to component props
const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  count: state.count
});

// Map dispatching actions to component props
const mapDispatchToProps = {
  increment: () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' }),
  decrement: () => ({ type: 'DECREMENT' })
};

// Connect component to Redux store
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```

### Mapping State and Dispatch to Props

- `mapStateToProps`: This function maps the Redux store's state to the props of your React component. It takes the Redux state as an argument and returns an object. Each field in the returned object will become a prop for the connected component.
- `mapDispatchToProps`: This function maps dispatching actions to props of your React component. It can be an object where each field is an action creator function, or a function that receives `dispatch` as an argument and returns an object. Each action creator will be wrapped automatically with `dispatch` so they can be called directly.

In the example:

- `mapStateToProps` maps the `count` field from the Redux state (`state.count`) to the `count` prop of the `Counter` component.
- `mapDispatchToProps` maps the `increment` and `decrement` actions to props, so clicking the buttons in the `Counter` component will dispatch the corresponding actions (`{ type: 'INCREMENT' }` and `{ type: 'DECREMENT' }`).

### Using Connected Components in Your Application

Once a component is connected to the Redux store using `connect`, it can access Redux state and dispatch actions via props. Here’s how you can use connected components in your application:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // Import your root reducer
import App from './App'; // Import your connected component

// Create Redux store with root reducer
const store = createStore(rootReducer);

// Render the App component inside the Provider
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

In this setup:

- `Provider` is a component from `react-redux` that makes the Redux store available to any nested components that have been connected using `connect`.
- `store` is created using `createStore` and combined with a root reducer (`rootReducer`) that combines all your reducers into one.

By wrapping your top-level component (`App` in this case) with `Provider` and passing the Redux store as a prop, all connected components within your application can access the Redux store and interact with it through props (`mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` mappings).

## Advanced Redux Data Flow Techniques

Advanced Redux data flow techniques expand upon the fundamental principles of managing state in complex applications. These techniques go beyond basic actions and reducers, introducing concepts such as middleware, selectors, and asynchronous actions.

### Asynchronous Actions (Redux Thunk, Redux Saga)

In Redux, handling asynchronous actions involves managing actions that have side effects, such as fetching data from a server or updating state asynchronously. Redux provides several middleware solutions to handle asynchronous actions effectively.

#### Redux Thunk

Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action object. This function can then perform asynchronous operations and dispatch regular synchronous actions when the asynchronous operations complete.

Example of using Redux Thunk for asynchronous actions:

**Setting up Redux Thunk Middleware**:

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // Import your root reducer

// Create Redux store with thunk middleware
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```

**Async Action Creator using Redux Thunk**:

```js
// Action creator function using Redux Thunk
const fetchPosts = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST' });

    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
      const posts = await response.json();
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS', payload: posts });
    } catch (error) {
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_FAILURE', error: error.message });
    }
  };
};
```

In this example:

- `fetchPosts` is an action creator that returns a function instead of an action object.
- Inside the function, you can perform asynchronous operations (like fetching data) and dispatch actions based on the result.
- Redux Thunk middleware intercepts functions returned by action creators, enabling asynchronous actions in Redux.

#### Redux Saga

Redux Saga is another middleware for handling side effects in Redux applications. It uses ES6 generators to make asynchronous code easier to read, write, and test.

::: tip Example of using Redux Saga for handling asynchronous actions

**Setting up Redux Saga Middleware**:

```js
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga';
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // Import your root reducer
import rootSaga from './sagas'; // Import your root saga

// Create Redux Saga middleware
const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

// Create Redux store with Saga middleware
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware));

// Run the root saga
sagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga);
```

**Example Saga (rootSaga.js)**:

```js
import { all, call, put, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import { fetchPostsSuccess, fetchPostsFailure } from './actions'; // Import your action creators

// Worker saga for fetching posts
function* fetchPostsSaga() {
  try {
    const response = yield call(fetch, 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    const posts = yield call([response, 'json']);
    yield put(fetchPostsSuccess(posts));
  } catch (error) {
    yield put(fetchPostsFailure(error.message));
  }
}

// Watcher saga to listen for FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST action
function* watchFetchPosts() {
  yield takeEvery('FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST', fetchPostsSaga);
}

// Root saga
export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([
    watchFetchPosts()
    // Add more watchers if needed
  ]);
}
```

In this example:

- `fetchPostsSaga` is a worker saga that performs the asynchronous operation (fetching posts).
- `watchFetchPosts` is a watcher saga that listens for specific actions (`FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST`) and triggers the corresponding worker saga.
- `rootSaga` combines multiple sagas using `all` and runs them using `sagaMiddleware.run`.

:::

### Middleware for Extending Redux Functionality

Middleware in Redux provides a way to extend the Redux store's capabilities, such as logging actions, handling asynchronous operations, routing, and more. Middleware sits between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer, allowing interception and manipulation of actions.

::: tip Example of Custom Middleware

```js
const loggerMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  console.log('Dispatching action:', action);
  const result = next(action);
  console.log('New state:', store.getState());
  return result;
};

// Applying custom middleware to Redux store
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // Import your root reducer

// Create Redux store with custom middleware
const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(loggerMiddleware));
```

In this example:

- `loggerMiddleware` is a custom middleware function that logs each dispatched action and the resulting state.
- `next` is a function provided by Redux that allows the action to continue to the next middleware or the reducer.
- Custom middleware enhances Redux functionality by intercepting actions, performing custom logic, and optionally dispatching new actions or modifying existing ones.

## Best Practices for Managing Data Flow in Redux

Redux provides a structured way to manage state in JavaScript applications, but effective usage requires adhering to best practices. Here are my key recommendations for managing data flow in Redux:

### Organizing Reducers and Actions

#### File Structure and Organization

- **Separate concerns**: Keep actions, reducers, and selectors in separate files to maintain clarity and modularity.
- **Feature-based structure**: Group related actions and reducers together based on features rather than types.

```plaintext title="file structure"
src/
├── actions/
│   ├── todosActions.js
│   └── userActions.js
├── reducers/
│   ├── todosReducer.js
│   └── userReducer.js
├── selectors/
│   ├── todosSelectors.js
│   └── userSelectors.js
└── store.js
```

#### Action Types

- **Constants**: Use constants or enums for action types to prevent typos and ensure consistency.

```js
// Action types
export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';
export const DELETE_TODO = 'DELETE_TODO';
```

#### Reducer Composition

- **Combine reducers**: Use `combineReducers` from Redux to combine multiple reducers into a single root reducer.

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import todosReducer from './todosReducer';
import userReducer from './userReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  todos: todosReducer,
  user: userReducer
});

export default rootReducer;
```

### Immutable State Updates

#### Immutability with Spread Operator

- **Use spread operator (`...`)**: Create new objects or arrays when updating state to maintain immutability.

```js
// Updating an array in Redux state
const todosReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          {
            id: action.id,
            text: action.text,
            completed: false
          }
        ]
      };
    case TOGGLE_TODO:
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: state.todos.map(todo =>
          (todo.id === action.id) ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
        )
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

#### Immutable Libraries

- **`Immutable.js`**: Consider using libraries like Immutable.js for more complex data structures to enforce immutability and optimize performance.

```js
import { Map, List } from 'immutable';

const initialState = Map({
  todos: List(),
  user: Map()
});

const todosReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return state.update('todos', todos => todos.push(Map({
        id: action.id,
        text: action.text,
        completed: false
      })));

    case TOGGLE_TODO:
      return state.update('todos', todos =>
        todos.map(todo =>
          (todo.get('id') === action.id) ? todo.set('completed', !todo.get('completed')) : todo
        )
      );

    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

### Testing Redux Applications

#### Unit Testing

- **Reducers**: Test reducers to ensure they handle actions correctly and return the expected state.

```js
describe('todosReducer', () => {
  it('should handle ADD_TODO', () => {
    const action = { type: 'ADD_TODO', id: 1, text: 'Test todo' };
    const initialState = { todos: [] };
    const expectedState = { todos: [{ id: 1, text: 'Test todo', completed: false }] };

    expect(todosReducer(initialState, action)).toEqual(expectedState);
  });
});
```

#### Integration Testing

- **Action Creators and Thunks**: Test action creators and thunks to verify they dispatch the correct actions or handle asynchronous operations.

```js
describe('fetchPosts action creator', () => {
  it('creates FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS when fetching posts has been done', () => {
    const expectedActions = [
      { type: 'FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST' },
      { type: 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS', payload: { /* mocked data */ } }
    ];

    const store = mockStore({ posts: [] });

    return store.dispatch(fetchPosts()).then(() => {
      expect(store.getActions()).toEqual(expectedActions);
    });
  });
});
```

#### Integration with Components

- **Connected Components**: Test connected components using `redux-mock-store` to simulate Redux store behavior.

```js
import configureStore from 'redux-mock-store';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

const mockStore = configureStore([]);

describe('<App />', () => {
  it('renders App component', () => {
    const store = mockStore({ /* mocked state */ });

    const { getByText } = render(
      <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
    );

    expect(getByText('Welcome to Redux App')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
