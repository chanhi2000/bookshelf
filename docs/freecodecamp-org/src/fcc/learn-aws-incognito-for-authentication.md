Whether you're building a web app, mobile app, or API, understanding how to implement robust authentication and authorization is a critical skill. AWS Cognito is a powerful ability that simplifies user management, authentication, and access control, making it an essential technology for developers and businesses alike. By mastering AWS Cognito, you can build secure, scalable applications while integrating seamlessly with other AWS services. If you're looking to enhance your skills in this area, we have the perfect resource for you.

We just posted a course on the [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel about AWS Cognito that will take you from beginner to expert. This comprehensive course covers everything you need to know about AWS Cognito, from understanding User Pools and Identity Pools to implementing OAuth 2.0 workflows and JWT authentication.

You'll also learn how to integrate Cognito with popular frameworks like React and Node.js, implement role-based access control, and secure APIs using Cognito authorizers. The course is packed with hands-on exercises, including building a secure file-sharing application using AWS Cognito, S3, and React, so you can apply what you learn in real-world scenarios. Rishi Tiwari developed this course.

Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll learn in this course:

- **AWS Cognito Fundamentals**: Understand the differences between User Pools, Identity Pools, and IAM, and how they work together to manage authentication and authorization.
- **OAuth 2.0 and JWT Authentication**: Dive deep into OAuth 2.0 workflows, grant types, and secure implementations using PKCE and state parameters. Learn how to work with JWT tokens for access and identity management.
- **Framework Integration**: Master integrating AWS Cognito with ReactJS for single-page applications (SPAs) and Node.js for backend services. You'll also explore how to use Cognito with traditional backends and third-party identity providers like Google.
- **API Security**: Learn how to secure APIs using Cognito authorizers and the AWS API Gateway, ensuring your applications are protected against unauthorized access.
- **Hands-On Project**: Build a secure file-sharing application, "ShareMyFiles," using AWS Cognito, S3, and React. This project will give you practical experience in applying the concepts covered in the course.

The course is divided into clear, easy-to-follow chapters, including:

- Course Introduction
- AWS Cognito User Pool vs Identity Pool vs IAM
- OAuth 2.0 Workflow and Grant Types in Amazon Cognito
- JWT Authentication - Access Token and ID Token
- Cognito with ReactJS SPA and Node.js Backend
- Secure the AWS API Gateway Using Cognito User Pools
- ShareMyFiles - Secure File Sharing App
