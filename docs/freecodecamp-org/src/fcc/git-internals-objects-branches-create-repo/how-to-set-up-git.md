Let‚Äôs create a new directory, and run `git status` within it:

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-106.png)

Alright, so `git` seems unhappy as we don‚Äôt have a <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git` folder. The natural thing to do would be to simply create that directory:

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-107.png)

Apparently, creating a <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git` directory is just not enough. We need to add some content to that directory.

**A** **git repository has two** main **components**:

1. A collection of objects ‚Äî **blobs**, **trees,** and **commits**.
2. A system of naming those objects ‚Äî called **references**.

A **repository** may also contain other things, such as git hooks, but at the very least ‚Äî it must include objects and references.

Let‚Äôs create a directory for the objects at <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\objects` and a directory for the references (in short: **refs**) at <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\refs` (on UNIX -based systems ‚Äî <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git/objects` and <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git/refs`, respectively).

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-108.png)

One type of reference is **branches**. Internally, `git` calls **branches** by the name **heads**. So we will create a directory for them ‚Äî <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\refs\heads`.

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-109.png)

![This still doesn‚Äôt change our `git status`](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-110.png)

How does `git` know where to start when looking for a **commit** in the **repository**? As I explained earlier, it looks for `HEAD`, which points to the current active branch (or **commit**, in some cases).

So, we need to create the `HEAD`, which is just a file residing at <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\HEAD`. We can apply the following:

::: tabs

@tab:active <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-windows"/>

```batch
ECHO ref: refs/heads/master > .git\HEAD`
```

@tab <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-linux"/>

```sh
echo "ref: refs/heads/master" > .git/HEAD
```

:::

‚≠ê So we now know how `HEAD` is implemented ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply a file, and its contents describe what it points to.

![Following the command above, `git status` seems to change its mind:](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-111.png)

Notice that `git` believes we are on a branch called <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master`, even though we haven‚Äôt created this branch. As mentioned before, <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master` is just a name. We could also make `git` believe we are on a branch called <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`banana` if we wanted to:

![üçå](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-112.png)

We will switch back to <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master` for the rest of this post, just to adhere to the normal convention.

Now that we have our <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git` directory ready, can we work our way to make a **commit** (again, without using `git add` or `git commit`).
