At this point, it would be helpful to make a distinction between two types of `git` commands: **plumbing** and **porcelain**. The application of the terms oddly comes from toilets (yeah, these ‚Äî üöΩ), traditionally made of porcelain, and the infrastructure of plumbing (pipes and drains).

We can say that the porcelain layer provides a user-friendly interface to the plumbing. Most people only deal with the porcelain. Yet, when things go (terribly) wrong, and someone wants to understand why, they would have to roll-up their sleeves to check the plumbing. (Note: these terms are not mine, they are used very widely in `git`).

`git` uses this terminology as an analogy to separate the low-level commands that users don‚Äôt usually need to use directly (‚Äúplumbing‚Äù commands) from the more user-friendly high level commands (‚Äúporcelain‚Äù commands).

So far, we have dealt with porcelain commands ‚Äî `git init`, `git add` or `git commit`. Next, we transition to plumbing commands.
