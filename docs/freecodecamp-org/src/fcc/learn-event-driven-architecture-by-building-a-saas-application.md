Building modern, scalable web applications requires mastering the tools and patterns that power dynamic, production-ready platforms. Event-driven architecture is one of these patterns, enabling applications to efficiently handle real-time interactions and asynchronous workflows. If you’ve ever wanted to build a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application using cutting-edge tools like Next.js, Clerk, and NeonDB, this course is your perfect guide.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create a modern SaaS application using **Next.js** and **Clerk**, with a focus on **event-driven architecture**. Created by Hitesh Choudhary, this course offers an in-depth journey into building scalable, production-ready applications. You’ll learn to implement features like webhooks, authentication flows, role-based access control, database management, and CRUD operations. By the end, you’ll have the skills to create robust applications that can scale to meet real-world demands.

## What You’ll Learn in This Course

This course covers everything you need to build and manage a modern SaaS application:

### 1. Building a SaaS Starter Template

Get started with **Next.js** and **Clerk** to create a foundational SaaS template. This section sets up the essential components for authentication, user management, and application structure.

### 2. Understanding Event-Driven Architecture

Learn the fundamentals of event-driven systems, focusing on how to use **Clerk webhooks** to handle asynchronous events and streamline communication between services.

### 3. Database Management with NeonDB and Prisma

Learn how to integrate and manage a **PostgreSQL database** using **NeonDB** and **Prisma**. This section covers database setup, schema design, and advanced techniques like CRUD operations and pagination.

### 4. Custom Authentication Flows

Implement custom sign-up flows using Clerk. You’ll explore how to tailor the user experience to your application’s unique requirements.

### 5. Role-Based Access Control

Use **Clerk middleware** to build role-based access controls, ensuring users have the right permissions based on their roles within the application.

### 6. Handling Webhooks

Gain a deep understanding of **webhooks**, with practical examples of how to set up, receive, and process events in your application. This skill is crucial for building responsive, real-time systems.

### 7. API Integration and Frontend Handling

Learn how to handle API calls from the frontend with Next.js. You’ll build seamless interactions between your application’s user interface and backend services.
