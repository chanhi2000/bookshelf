You can learn modern application architecture by building real-world serverless and microservices solutions using C# and Azure.

We just posted a full course on the freeCodeCamp that will teach you to build scaleable cloud applications. Muhammad Abdullah developed this course.

This hands-on course takes you from fundamental concepts to production-ready implementations, covering everything from Azure Functions and Docker containers to advanced orchestration with Kubernetes and .NET Aspire.

Here are the sections in this course:

- What is Serverless?
- Understanding Serverless Architecture
- Microservices Types & Patterns Explained
- Onion Architecture Explained
- Docker Demystified
- Azure Functions and Triggers
- Background Functions in Azure
- IoT Functions
- Microservices in Practice - Route Planning
- Introduction to Kubernetes

Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/xHUwGx-ZlTM) (5-hour watch).
