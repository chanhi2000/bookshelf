To prepare for any web development interview, you need to get familiar with JavaScript fundamentals no matter what framework is listed in the job description. Framework based questions are always secondary to JavaScript fundamentals, so expect to get tested on JavaScript first.

If you are a beginner, you need to clear JavaScript fundamentals before jumping into React. A lot of people (including me) make the mistake of jumping straight into React after learning a bit of JavaScript.

I have written a detailed post on [important JavaScript concepts for interviews](/freecodecamp.org/js-interview-prep-handbook/README.md). You can include this as part of your React interview preparation. If you are clear on all JavaScript fundamentals, you can skip to the next section.
