Learn how to create a complete iOS app from scratch using SwiftUI and Xcode.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you to build a feature-rich movie and TV browsing app with a dynamic home screen, powerful search, and detail screens that play YouTube trailers.

You will also implement a download manager to save titles for offline viewing using SwiftData. By integrating The Movie Database and YouTube APIs, this project provides excellent hands-on practice with SwiftUI, API integration, and modern data storage. Carlos Valentin created this course.

Here are the sections in this course:

- Essentials
- Networking
- API Networking Requests
- Navigation
- Search
- SwiftData

Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/-VC3hIEL7eQ) (4-hour watch).
