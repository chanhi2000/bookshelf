Looking to get hands-on with AI? We just posted a comprehensive course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel designed to help you build powerful AI agent applications. Led by Cerebras growth engineer Sarah Chieng alongside industry experts from Exa, LangChain, and LiveKit, this 3-part series is has everything you need to get started with real-world AI use cases.

Cerebras provided a grant to make this course possible. Cerebras creates chips that are built on a custom wafer-sized AI processor and are 20X faster than GPUs. You can get a free Cerebras API key at [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>https://cloud.cerebras.ai?referral_code=freecodecamp](https://cloud.cerebras.ai?referral_code=freecodecamp).

## What You'll Build

Throughout the series, we’ll walk you through how to create

- Interactive Voice Agents - Build conversational AI that can speak and listen in real-time
- Intelligent Research Assistants - Create AI systems that can search, analyze, and synthesize information from across the web
- Multi-Agent Workflows - Develop sophisticated systems where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve complex tasks

Each workshop includes sample code, practical exercises, and open-source example repositories to help you follow along and build your own projects. You'll learn how to use popular AI tools and frameworks like LiveKit for real-time communication, Exa for intelligent web search, and LangChain for building multi-agent AI applications.
