Learn to build AI agents with Langbase.

We just posted a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to create context-engineered agents that use memory and AI primitives to take action and deliver accurate, production-ready results using Langbase.

Langbase is a powerful serverless AI cloud for building and deploying AI agents. A great alternative to bloated frameworks, Langbase gives you simple AI primitives including Pipes, Memory (RAG), Workflows, and Tools, allowing you to easily build, deploy, and scale serverless AI agents.

Context-engineered agents are AI agents powered by LLMs and enhanced with tools and long-term memory (Agentic RAG). Instead of only responding to prompts, they can also:

- Retrieve knowledge from documents and data.
- Take real-world actions with tools.
- Maintain workflows and context across conversations.

In this course, you’ll:

- Create your first Agentic RAG system using Langbase Pipes and memory agents.
- Deploy and scale serverless agents in Langbase Studio.
- Vibe code AI agents using Command.new.

The course covers:

- Explaining context engineering and the agentic RAG pipeline.
- Building memory agents.
- Using Langbase AI primitives including Workflow, Parser, Chunker, Embed, and Memory to build any type of AI agent.
- Deploying and scaling serverless AI agents without frameworks.

Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/BMt-qvrEcFY) (1-hour watch).
