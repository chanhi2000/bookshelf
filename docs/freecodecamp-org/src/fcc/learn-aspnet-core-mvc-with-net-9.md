If you're looking to build modern web applications using Microsoft's .NET platform, ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core are essential technologies to master. ASP.NET Core MVC is a powerful framework for creating web apps following the Model-View-Controller pattern, while Entity Framework Core simplifies data access by allowing you to interact with databases using C#. Together, these tools offer a seamless and efficient way to develop robust and scalable applications.

We just published a course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you all about ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core in .NET 9. This beginner-friendly, step-by-step tutorial, developed by Alen Omeri, will guide you through everything you need to know to start building dynamic web applications from scratch.

The course starts with an overview of ASP.NET Core MVC and explains the basics of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. You'll learn how to set up a development environment for .NET 9 and get familiar with the typical file structure of an ASP.NET Core MVC project. As you progress, you'll see MVC in action, understanding key concepts such as `IActionResult`, action parameters, and the Razor syntax, which is used to generate dynamic web pages.

One of the core focuses of the course is data management. You'll learn about Entity Framework Core, a powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that enables you to work with databases directly in C#. The course covers both code-first and database-first approaches, giving you flexibility in how you design your applications. You'll also get hands-on experience with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which are fundamental for managing data in web apps.

In addition to these basics, the course takes a deeper dive into database relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, which are critical for building complex data models. These concepts will help you design databases that reflect real-world scenarios, ensuring your web applications can handle various user and data interactions.

By the end of this course, you'll have a strong foundation in [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>ASP.NET](https://asp.net) Core MVC and Entity Framework Core and be ready to start building your own .NET applications. Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/RWXKysImabs) (2-hour watch).
