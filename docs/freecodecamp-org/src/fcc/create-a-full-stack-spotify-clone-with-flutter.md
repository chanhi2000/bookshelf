Have you ever wondered how apps like Spotify are built? Now’s your chance to learn! With the power of modern technologies like Flutter, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL, you can create a full-featured music streaming app from scratch.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a full-stack music streaming app similar to Spotify. This comprehensive course, led by Rivaan Ranawat, will teach you how to develop apps using the MVVM architecture. You’ll learn how to create a beautifully designed app using Flutter for the frontend, a robust backend with FastAPI, and efficient data management with PostgreSQL. The course also explores Hive for local data storage and leverages Riverpod (Generators) for state management. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional app capable of streaming music, managing user accounts, and offering features like favorites, recently played songs, and background music playback.

## What You’ll Learn

Here’s what’s covered in this course:

### 1. Getting Started

Begin with setting up your environment and installing the required tools, including Flutter and FastAPI. Learn the project structure and boilerplate setup.

### 2. Building the Frontend with Flutter

- Master Flutter UI design with a focus on creating responsive and visually appealing components like signup and login pages.
- Dive into theming, form validation, and Material Design principles.

### 3. Backend with FastAPI

- Explore FastAPI for creating robust RESTful APIs.
- Set up a PostgreSQL database and work with SQLAlchemy to handle data.
- Implement authentication routes and secure your app with JWT tokens.

### 4. State Management with Riverpod Generators

- Learn to manage app state efficiently with Riverpod, ensuring seamless user experiences.
- Implement features like persisting auth state and fetching user data.

### 5. Music Features

- Create functionalities for uploading, fetching, and playing songs.
- Implement a music player UI with controls like play, pause, and song progress tracking.
- Store and display recently played music using Hive.

### 6. Advanced Features

- Add favorites functionality for both backend and frontend.
- Enable background music playback in Flutter for uninterrupted listening.

## Why Take This Course?

This course goes beyond just building a basic app—it offers a deep dive into real-world development practices. The **MVVM architecture** ensures your app is scalable and maintainable, while tools like Hive and PostgreSQL teach you how to handle both local and server-side data. Rivaan Ranawat’s teaching style is hands-on, with each concept broken down into manageable steps. You’ll encounter practical scenarios like error handling (e.g., psycopg2 errors) and optimization, preparing you for real-world development challenges.
