Learn and master the most common data structures in this free 8-hour video course from Google engineer William Fiset.

This course teaches data structures using animations to represent the data structures visually. And it's designed with beginners in mind.

You'll learn how to code various data structures and combine them through Finet's step-by-step instructions.

Each data structure comes with working source code to help solidify your understanding. The code snippets are in Java, but if you know JavaScript or Python you will probably be able to understand these just fine on a conceptual level.

You will learn about these data structures:

- Static and dynamic arrays
- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Heaps/Priority Queues
- Binary Trees/Binary Search Trees
- Union find/Disjoint Set
- Hash tables
- Fenwick trees
- AVL trees

You can watch the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>full video on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/RBSGKlAvoiM) (8 hour watch). As always, it's free, and there are no ads to interrupt you.
