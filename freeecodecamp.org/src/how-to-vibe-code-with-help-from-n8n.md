Learn the power of vibe coding and how it pairs perfectly with n8n to build full-stack AI-driven apps.

We just published a crash course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you the power of VibeCoding and how to automate real-world workflows using n8n. This course starts by demystifying what software engineers actually do and introduces you to the VibeCoding movement, which is an approach that blends human creativity with AI-driven automation. Paulo Dichone from Vinci bits created this course.

You’ll learn about the origins of VibeCoding, why it’s accessible to everyone, and how it can transform your approach to building software. The course walks through the entire vibe coding workflow, connecting it to core software engineering principles so you can vibe code like a pro.

A key part of this course is n8n, an open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect different apps, APIs, and services without writing tons of code. Think of n8n as a visual platform where you can drag, drop, and link together building blocks to automate tasks, process data, and build complex backend systems.

You will learn how to set up n8n, create your first workflows and webhooks, and use AI coding agents to build powerful frontends that interact with your automated backend. Along the way, you’ll tackle real challenges like processing files, handling binary data, and troubleshooting workflow issues.

Here are the different sections covered in this course:

- What do Software Engineers do?
- Vibe Coding - Who Started This Movement?
- Fear Not Vibe Coding - Here’s Why
- Vibe Coding - the Full Workflow
- Bring it All Together - Vibecoding and Software Engineering Principles - Vibecoding Like an Engineer
- LLM and Context - Why Does it Matter?
- The Path to Follow when Vibe Coding
- How To Think About Vibe Coding to Build Production Applications
- Setting up N8N
- Basics on N8N - Create your First Workflow and Webhooks
- Leveraging AI Coding Agents to Build the Frontend - Intro to [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Bolt.new](http://Bolt.new) - Upload Files to our N8N Backend
- Adding an N8N Switch Node to our Backend Workflow - Processing PDF, TXT, and CSV Files
- Understanding Binary Files and Troubleshooting N8N Issues
- An Overview of the Workflow Architecture - Bulletproofing the Workflow for Further Processing Downstream
- Adding a Code Node to our N8N Workflow for Processing Data
- Deconstructing the Field Extraction Node Code
- Combining Extracted Data through the Code Node
- Testing the Workflow - Full File Upload and File Processing Workflow
- Final Thoughts and Where to Go From Here

By the end of this course, you’ll have the VibeCoding mindset and a production-ready AI automation system built with n8n and AI tools. Watch the full course [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/qDtVzumlb8M) (2-hour watch).
