**Objective:** Use LLM to analyze data from soil sensors, satellite imagery, and weather forecasts to optimize irrigation and fertilizer use while maintaining sustainability. This example will help farmers optimize resource use, reduce environmental impact, and promote sustainable land management.

```py :collapsed-lines
import openai

# Sample input data from soil sensors, satellite imagery, and weather forecasts
farm_data = {
    "soil_moisture": {
        "zone_A": 45,  # percentage
        "zone_B": 30,  # percentage
    },
    "satellite_imagery": {
        "vegetation_health_index": 0.85,  # normalized between 0 to 1
    },
    "weather_forecast": {
        "today": {"temperature": 28, "humidity": 65, "precipitation": 3},  # in °C, %, mm
        "next_week_precipitation": 15,  # mm of rain expected over the next week
    }
}

# Describe data for LLM input
data_summary = (
    f"Zone A soil moisture is at {farm_data['soil_moisture']['zone_A']}%, while Zone B is at {farm_data['soil_moisture']['zone_B']}%. "
    f"The satellite imagery shows a vegetation health index of {farm_data['satellite_imagery']['vegetation_health_index']}. "
    f"Today's weather forecast indicates a temperature of {farm_data['weather_forecast']['today']['temperature']}°C, "
    f"with 65% humidity and 3mm precipitation. The forecasted rainfall for the next week is 15mm."
)

# Use LLM to generate sustainable irrigation and fertilization recommendations
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI agricultural assistant specializing in sustainable precision farming."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Based on the following data, provide sustainable irrigation and fertilization recommendations: {data_summary}"}

```md :collapsed-lines title="Sample Output"
**Sustainable Irrigation and Fertilization Recommendations:**

- **Zone A Irrigation:** Since soil moisture is at 45%, no immediate irrigation is needed. Reassess after the next rainfall. Depending on the forecasted 15mm rain, irrigation may not be necessary for at least 5 days.

- **Zone B Irrigation:** Soil moisture in Zone B is at 30%, which is approaching a critical threshold. Schedule light irrigation (20mm) for Zone B tomorrow to maintain optimal soil moisture, then reassess after the next week's rain.
