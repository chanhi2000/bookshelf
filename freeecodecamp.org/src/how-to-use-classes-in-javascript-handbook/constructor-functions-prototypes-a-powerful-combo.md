We've now seen how constructor functions act as blueprints for creating objects, and how using the prototype of a constructor function lets us efficiently share methods among all objects created from that blueprint.

This is a key pattern in JavaScript for creating reusable object structures.

## Okay, we've covered object creation and efficient methods... But what about inheritance with constructor functions?

What if we want to create a `DeveloperPerson` blueprint that inherits from our `PersonConstructor` blueprint? So that `DeveloperPerson` objects automatically has `name`, `age`, and `greet`, but can also have its own special developer-related properties and methods?

That's where things get a bit more involved with constructor functions, and we'll need to use a special trick called `call()` to make inheritance work. Let's dive into that next.
