R is a popular programming language that‚Äôs now widely used in research-related fields like Bioinformatics.

And to use R, you‚Äôll need to install the R Compiler and R Studio. But did you know that you can also directly run your R code right in a Jupyter Notebook? This helps in so many ways if you are already used to using Jupyter Notebook for Machine Learning-related tasks using Python.

In this tutorial, I‚Äôll show you exactly how you can set up your local machine to run the R programming language directly in Jupyter Notebook. The processes I am going to show you today are equally applicable to all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, and Linux OSes).

## Install Conda

You‚Äôd normally use Conda to handle multiple environments in Python. And here, we‚Äôre going to use the same Conda program to install R in our environment. You can either use [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/) or [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

I prefer Miniconda as it‚Äôs so lightweight. You‚Äôll also get the opportunity to install the latest packages directly using Miniconda. But you can simply go with the Anaconda if you are already comfortable with that.

---

## Create a New Environment

Many people tend to use the Base environment. But I never like to use the Base environment directly as you typically need multiple environments for handling different package and versions of packages as well.

So I‚Äôll create a new environment where I‚Äôll work on my R programming language-related tasks using Jupyter Notebook.

To create a new Conda environment, simply use the following command:

```sh
conda create --name r-conda
```

Here, `r-conda` is my Conda environment‚Äôs name. You can choose any other name, but keep in mind that the conda env name can not have any whitespaces in it.

It will create a new Conda environment named `r-conda` for me.

---

## Activate Your Conda Environment

If you want to work on a separate conda environment, you‚Äôll need to make sure that you‚Äôre activating that specific conda environment before starting to do anything.

I want to work on the `r-conda` conda environment. So I can simply activate the conda environment using the following command:

```sh
conda activate r-conda
```

You need to use the exact conda env name that you want if it‚Äôs different than `r-conda` in the command.

::: note üí°

Keep in mind that you need to activate the conda environment successfully before proceeding further.

:::

You will see the conda environment‚Äôs name as `(conda-env-name)` at the left side of your terminal.

![activate conda env](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727898007890/f8bf9ced-6c9e-4198-9116-63a32e7d0f03.png)

## Install `ipykernel` and `jupyter`

I always like to install the `ipykernel` and `jupyter` in all of my conda environments as they help manage different conda environments‚Äô Jupyter notebooks/labs separately.

So I‚Äôm going to install them together in my conda env by using the command below:

```sh
conda install ipykernel jupyter
```

This will install both `ipykernel` and `jupyter` in the activated conda environment.

---

## Install R in the Conda Environment

To install R directly in the conda environment, simply use the following command:

```sh
conda install -c r r-irkernel
```

This will install the necessary components that enable your local computer to run the R program in your Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Open the Jupyter Notebook

Now you can open the Jupyter Notebook either by using `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8889 --no-browser --allow-root --NotebookApp.token=''`. Just make sure to modify the IP, port, root configuration, and token as you see fit for your work.

Open the given link in the terminal to open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.

## Run R in Jupyter Notebook

After opening Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, when you want to create a new notebook for R, you will get `R` directly in the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù menu like the image given below.

Now, you can use the R language directly in your Jupyter Notebook!

You can also see the R programming language logo at the top right side of your Notebook.
