Prepare for the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer (ACE) exam and pass!

We just published an updated Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel. Andrew Brown from ExamPro developed this course.

Associate Cloud Engineers deploy applications, monitor operations, and manage enterprise solutions. They use Google Cloud Console and the command-line interface to perform common platform-based tasks to maintain one or more deployed solutions that leverage Google-managed or self-managed services on Google Cloud.

Here are the sections in this course:

- Introduction
- Identity access and resource setup
- Billing configuration
- Serverless and app deployment
- Data storage options
- Compute engine deployment
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) deployment
- Networking resources
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Compute engine operations
- Storage and database solutions
- Monitoring and Logging
- Cloud identity and directory services

Watch the full course on [<FontIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/OlAmyf8_4O4) (11-hour watch).
