Access control is crucial for preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that only the right people can access sensitive data in your application. As your app grows in complexity, so does the challenge of enforcing permissions in a clean and efficient way.

In this handbook, we’ll explore various access control mechanisms and walk through two approaches for building a scalable Attribute-Based Access Control solution in React.

First, we'll examine CASL, a popular open-source authorization library. Then, we’ll build a custom solution from scratch to deepen your understanding of how to design a flexible permissions validation system.

This guide includes detailed code walkthroughs for both approaches, covering key concepts such as state management, custom hooks, and caching/conditional queries using Redux Toolkit.

If you plan to implement the code, you should have a basic understanding of how a web app using state management works. But even if you're not coding along, you’ll still gain valuable insights into the design patterns and best practices behind creating a robust permissions validation system.

Let’s dive in!
