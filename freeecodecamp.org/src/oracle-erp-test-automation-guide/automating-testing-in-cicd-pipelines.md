Automating testing in your CI/CD pipelines speeds up the release process. It helps maintain high-quality Oracle ERP applications. Automated tests run at each stage of the pipeline. This ensures updates or changes to the ERP system are tested without slowing development.

Continuous testing is essential. It catches errors early, before they reach production. By running automated tests at each stage - whether it’s build, deploy, or merge - issues are found quickly and your team can resolve them faster. This reduces downtime and keeps the ERP system ready for deployment.

For Oracle ERP, automated tests check updates, customizations, and integrations. These tests cover many scenarios. Functional tests ensure features work as expected. Performance tests check the system’s behavior under different loads. This approach reduces the risk of failures and allows faster releases.

Automated testing integrates smoothly with DevOps tools managing Oracle ERP modules. These tools coordinate testing across environments. Each module is tested both independently and as part of the system. Whether working with Oracle E-Business Suite or Oracle Cloud, CI/CD tools ensure consistency and continuous feedback.

## Example: How Automated Testing Works in CI/CD for Oracle ERP

Let’s look at an example where your team works on a custom update for Oracle E-Business Suite. Here’s how the process might go:

### Code Commit and Build:

Let’s say you commit new code or update to the version control system (for example, Git). This triggers the CI pipeline.

The CI tool (like Jenkins) automatically runs unit tests. These tests check if the code changes break any existing functionality.

::: tip Code Example:

You then commit and push changes to Git:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature in Oracle ERP"
git push origin feature-branch
```

:::

**CI Tool:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and so on

- Jenkins or another CI tool detects the new code commit and automatically triggers the build process.

**Action:**

- The build process starts automatically. Unit tests are executed to ensure no existing functionality breaks due to the new code changes.

::: tip Code Example:

In Jenkins, you might configure the <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-jenkins"/>`Jenkinsfile` for running unit tests after the build:

```groovy title="Jenkinsfile"
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn clean install'  // Example for Maven-based project
      }
    }
    stage('Unit Tests') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn test'  // Run unit tests to check for broken functionality
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Continuous Integration Testing:

After the build, automated tests run in a test environment. These tests cover different scenarios:

- **Functional tests:** Does the new feature in the ERP module work as expected?
- **Regression tests:** Does the update break any existing features?
- **Integration tests:** Does the update work smoothly with other Oracle ERP modules?

::: tip Code Example:

In Jenkins, use the following commands to execute different test suites:

```sh
# Functional Test Example
./runFunctionalTests.sh --module ERP

# Regression Test Example
./runRegressionTests.sh --module Core

# Integration Test Example
./runIntegrationTests.sh --modules Sales, Finance
```

:::

In your testing script (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-shell"/>`runFunctionalTests.sh`), you might have something like this:

```sh title="runFunctionalTests.sh"
echo "Running functional tests for ERP module..."
mvn test -Dtest=FunctionalTests
```

### Deployment & End-to-End Testing:

Once the tests pass, the update is deployed to a staging environment. Here, end-to-end automated tests simulate real user interactions with the Oracle ERP system.

These tests ensure the system works correctly from a user’s perspective. They check workflows, data accuracy, and UI functionality.

::: tip Code Example:

The deployment script can deploy the build to the staging environment and then run end-to-end tests:

```sh
# Deploy the latest build to staging
./deployToStaging.sh

# Run End-to-End Tests
./runEndToEndTests.sh --env staging
```

The <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-shell"/>`runEndToEndTests.sh` script could look like:

```sh title="runEndToEndTests.sh"
echo "Running end-to-end tests..."
# Example command to run a tool like Selenium
java -jar selenium-tests.jar --env staging
```

### Feedback & Rollback:

If tests fail, the CI/CD pipeline sends feedback to the development team. This lets them fix issues before production. For critical failures, the pipeline can trigger an automatic rollback. This ensures the system stays stable and functional.

This feedback loop helps teams fix issues quickly, before they affect end users. With automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline, your Oracle ERP system stays up-to-date, efficient, and reliable.

::: tip Code Example:

If tests fail, the pipeline sends feedback:

```sh
# Sample error message from failed tests
echo "Test failed: Functional test on Module A"
```

Here’s the <VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-shell"/>`rollback.sh` script:

```sh title="rollback.sh"
echo "Rolling back to the last stable version..."
git checkout last-stable-commit
git push origin master
```

### Monitoring & Feedback Loop

Continuous monitoring ensures that any further changes or issues are captured early. If any issues are found, feedback is sent back to the developers for quick resolution.

If the pipeline detects any failure at any stage (build, test, deploy), it notifies the team instantly via Slack, email, or other communication tools.

::: tip Code Example:

Sending feedback to developers via Slack:

```sh
# Notify Slack if a test fails
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
--data '{"text":"Build Failed: Test failure detected!"}' \
https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
