Unlock the power of data with SQL! Master one of the most in-demand skill in the data-driven world and supercharge your career with our new video course.

We just released a comprehensive video course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will take you on a journey from understanding the basics of relational databases to mastering advanced SQL concepts. This course has been meticulously designed to help you gain the knowledge and confidence you need to excel in SQL, whether you're a beginner or looking to sharpen your skills.

The team at Jovian developed this course. They have created many popular courses for both the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel and their own platform.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the most widely used language for interacting with relational databases. It's an essential skill for data science professionals and anyone who wants to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently. Our SQL tutorial course covers everything from setting up MySQL and inserting data to solving technical interview questions from top tech companies.

The course is divided into several sections, each covering a specific aspect of SQL. You'll start with an introduction to relational databases and SQL, followed by a step-by-step guide on setting up MySQL. As you progress, you'll learn how to insert data into tables and practice with exercises designed to solidify your understanding.

We will then explore the power of aggregation, grouping, and pagination in SQL queries, and teach you how to utilize mapping and arithmetic functions effectively. You'll also learn how to work with dates and manage time-related data in SQL.

One of the most sought-after skills in data science is the ability to combine tables using joins. Our course will show you how to do this effectively, allowing you to gain insights from data stored in multiple tables. You'll also learn how to execute SQL queries using Python and SQL Alchemy, further expanding your skill set.

To prepare you for real-world challenges, we have included a section dedicated to technical interview questions from companies like Apple, LinkedIn, Meta, Uber, Amazon, and Google. With our 3-step approach to solving these questions, you'll be well-equipped to tackle similar problems in your own interviews.

So, are you ready to embark on this exciting journey and become a SQL expert? Watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/-fW2X7fh7Yg) (5.5 hour watch).
