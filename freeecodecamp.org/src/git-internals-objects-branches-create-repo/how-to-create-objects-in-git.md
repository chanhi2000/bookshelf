Let's start with creating an object and writing it into the objects‚Äô database of `git`, residing within <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\objects`. We'll find the SHA-1 hash value of a **blob** by using our first plumbing command, `git hash-object`, in the following way:

::: tabs

@tab:active <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-windows"/>

```batch
ECHO git is awesome | git hash-object --stdin
```

@tab <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-linux"/>

```sh
echo "git is awesome" | git hash-object --stdin
```

By using `--stdin` we are instructing `git hash-object` to take its input from the standard input. This will provide us with the relevant hash value.

In order to actually write that **blob** into `git`‚Äôs object database, we can simply add the `-w` switch for `git hash-object`. Then, we can check the contents of the <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git` folder, and see that they have changed.

![Writing a blob to the objects‚Äô database](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-113.png)

We can now see that the hash of our **blob** is ‚Äî `54f6...36`. We can also see that a directory has been created under <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\objects`, a directory named `54`, and within it, a file by the name of `f6...36`.

So `git` actually takes the first two characters of the SHA-1 hash and uses them as the name of a directory. The remaining characters are used as the filename for the file that actually contains the **blob**.

Why is that so? Consider a fairly big repository, one that has 300,000 objects (**blobs**, **trees**, and **commits**) in its database. To look up a hash inside that list of 300,000 hashes can take a while. Thus, `git` simply divides that problem by 256. To look up the hash above, `git` would first look for the directory named `54` inside the directory <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\objects`, which may have up to 256 directories (`00` through `FF`). Then, it will search that directory, narrowing down the search as it goes.

Back to our process of generating a **commit**. We have now created an object. What is the type of that object? We can use another plumbing command, `git cat-file -t` (`-t` stands for ‚Äútype‚Äù), to check that out:

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-114.png)

Not surprisingly, this object is a **blob**.

![We can also use `git cat-file -p` (`-p` stands for ‚Äúpretty-print‚Äù) to see its contents:](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-115.png)

This process of creating a **blob** usually happens when we add something to the **staging area** ‚Äî that is, when we use `git add`.

Remember that `git` creates a **blob** of the *entire* file that is staged. Even if a single character is modified or added (as we added `!` in our example before), the file has a new **blob** with a new **hash**.

![Will there be any change to `git status`?](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-116.png)

Apparently, no. Adding a **blob** object to `git`‚Äôs internal database doesn‚Äôt change the status, as `git` doesn‚Äôt know of any tracked or untracked files at this stage.

We need to track this file‚Ää‚Äî add it to the **staging area**. To do that, we can use the plumbing command `git update-index`, like so: `git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 <blob-hash> <filename>`.

Note: (The `cacheinfo` is a 16-bit file mode [as stored by git](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/index-format.txt), following the layout of [POSIX types and modes](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/sys_stat.h.html). This is not within the scope of this post).

![Running the command above will result in a change to <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git`'s contents](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-117.png)

Can you spot the change? A new file by the name of `index` was created. This is it ‚Äî the famous **index** (or **staging area**), is basically a file that resides within <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\index`.

![So now that our **blob** has been added to the **index**, we expect `git status` to look different, like this](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-118.png)

That‚Äôs interesting! Two things happened here.

First, we can see that <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` appears in green, in the `Changes to be committed` area. That is so because the **index** now has <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt`, waiting to be committed.

Second, we can see that <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`new_file.txt` appears in red ‚Äî because `git` believes the *file* <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`my_file.txt` has been deleted, and the fact that the file has been deleted is not staged.

This happens as we added the **blob** with the contents `git is awesome` to the objects‚Äô database, and told the **index** that the file <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`my_file.txt` has the contents of that **blob**, but we never actually created that file.

We can easily solve this by taking the contents of the **blob**, and writing them to our file system, to a file called <VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-lines"/>`my_file.txt`:

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-119.png)

![As a result, it will no longer appear in red by `git status`](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-120.png)

So now it‚Äôs time to create a **commit** object from our **staging area**. As explained above, a **commit** object has a reference to a **tree**, so we need to create a **tree**.

We can do this with the command `git write-tree`, which records the contents of the **index** in a **tree** object. Of course, we can use `git cat-file -t` to see that it‚Äôs indeed a **tree**:

![Creating a tree object of the index*](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-121.png)

![And we can use `git cat-file -p` to see its contents:](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-122.png)

Great, so we created a **tree**, and now we need to create a **commit** object that references this **tree**.

![To do that, we can use `git commit-tree <tree-hash> -m <commit message>`](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-123.png)

You should now feel comfortable with the commands used to check the created object‚Äôs type, and print its contents:

![Creating a commit object](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-124.png)

Note that this **commit** doesn‚Äôt have a **parent**, because it‚Äôs the first **commit**. When we add another **commit** we will have to declare its **parent** ‚Äî we will do so later.

The last hash that we got ‚Äî `80e...8f` - is a **commit**‚Äôs hash. We are actually very used to using these hashes ‚Äî we look at them all the time. Note that this **commit** owns a **tree** object, with its own hash, which we rarely specify explicitly.

![Will something change in `git status`?](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-125.png)

Nope ü§î.

Why is that? Well, to know that our file has been committed, `git` needs to know about the latest **commit**. How does `git` do that? It goes to the `HEAD`:

![Looking at `HEAD` on Windows](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-126.png)

![Looking at `HEAD` on UNIX](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-127.png)

`HEAD` points to <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master`, but what is <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master`? We haven‚Äôt really created it yet.

As we explained earlier in this post, a branch is simply a named reference to a **commit**. And in this case, we would like <VPIcon icon="fas fa-code-branch"/>`master` to refer to the **commit** with the hash `80e8ed4fb0bfc3e7ba88ec417ecf2f6e6324998f`.

We can achieve this by simply creating a file at <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`\refs\heads\master`, with the contents of this hash, like so:

![](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-128.png)

::: note

In sum, a **branch** is just a file inside <VPIcon icon="fas fa-folder-open"/>`.git\refs\heads`, containing a hash of the **commit** it refers to.

![Now, finally, `git status` and `git log` seem to appreciate our efforts](https://freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/12/image-129.png)

:::

We have successfully created a **commit** without using porcelain commands! How cool is that? üéâ
