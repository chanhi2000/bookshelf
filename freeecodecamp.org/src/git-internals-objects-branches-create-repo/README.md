Many of us use `git` on a daily basis. But how many of us know what goes on under the hood?

For example, what happens when we use `git commit`? What is stored between commits? Is it just a diff between the current and previous commit? If so, how is the diff encoded? Or is an entire snapshot of the repo stored each time? What really happens when we use `git init`?

Many people who use `git` don‚Äôt know the answers to the questions above. But does it really matter?

First, as professionals, we should strive to understand the tools we use, especially if we use them all the time‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike `git`.

But even more acutely, I've found that understanding how git actually works is useful in many scenarios‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhether it‚Äôs resolving merge conflicts, looking to conduct an interesting rebase, or even just when something goes slightly wrong.

You‚Äôll benefit from this post if you‚Äôre experienced enough with `git` to feel comfortable with commands such as `git pull` ,`git push` ,`git add` or `git commit`.

Still, we will start with an overview to make sure we are on the same page regarding the mechanisms of `git`, and specifically, the terms used throughout this post.

I also uploaded a YouTube series covering this post‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou are welcome to watch it [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9lx0DXCC4BNUby5H58y6s2TQVLadV8v7).

## What to expect from this tutorial

We will get a rare understanding of what goes on under the hood of what we do almost daily.

We will start by covering objects‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää**blobs, trees,** and **commits.** We will then briefly discuss **branches** and how they are implemented. We will dive into the **working directory, staging area** and **repository**.

And we will make sure we understand how these terms relate to the `git` commands we know and use to create a new repository.

Next, will create a repository from scratch‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwithout using `git init`, `git add`, or `git commit`. This will allow us to **deepen our understanding of what is happening under the hood** when we work with `git`.

We will also create new branches, switch branches, and create additional commits‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall without using `git branch` or `git checkout`.

By the end of this post, **you will feel like you _understand_** `**git**`. Are you up for it? üòé

## Time to get hard core

So far we've covered some Git fundamentals, and now we‚Äôre ready to really *Git going.*

In order to deeply understand how `git` works, we will create a **repository**, but this time ‚Äî we'll build it from scratch.

We won‚Äôt use `git init`, `git add` or `git commit` which will enable us to get a better hands-on understanding of the process.

## Summary

This post introduced you to the internals of `git`. We started by covering the basic objects‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää**blobs**, **trees,** and **commits**.

We learned that a **blob** holds the contents of a file. A **tree** is a directory-listing, containing **blobs** and/or sub-**trees**. A **commit** is a snapshot of our working directory, with some meta-data such as the time or the commit message.

We then discussed **branches** and explained that they are nothing but a named reference to a **commit**.

We went on to describe the **working directory**, a directory that has a repository associated with it, the **staging area (index)** which holds the **tree** for the next **commit**, and the **repository**, which is a collection of **commits**.

We clarified how these terms relate to `git` commands we know by creating a new repository and committing a file using the well-known `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit`.

Then, we fearlessly deep-dived into `git`. We stopped using porcelain commands and switched to plumbing commands.

By using `echo` and low-level commands such as `git hash-object`, we were able to create a **blob**, add it to the **index**, create a **tree** of the **index**, and create a **commit** object pointing to that **tree**.

We were also able to create and switch between **branches**. Kudos to those of you who tried this on their own!üëè

Hopefully, after following this post you feel you‚Äôve deepened your understanding of what is happening under the hood when working with `git`.
