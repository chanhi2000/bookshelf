Event delegation takes advantage of event bubbling, allowing you to specify a single event handler to manage all events of a particular type. All events that use buttons (most mouse events and keyboard events) are suitable for the event delegation technique. Using event delegation can save memory.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Banana</li>
  <li>Pineapple</li>
</ul>
```

```js
// good
document.querySelector('ul').onclick = (event) => {
  const target = event.target
  if (target.nodeName === 'LI') {
    console.log(target.innerHTML)
  }
}

// bad
document.querySelectorAll('li').forEach((e) => {
  e.onclick = function() {
    console.log(this.innerHTML)
  }
})
```
