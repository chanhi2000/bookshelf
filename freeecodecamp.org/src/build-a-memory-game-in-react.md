Building interactive and accessible web applications is a crucial skill for modern developers. React, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries, provides a powerful way to create dynamic user interfaces. A great way to deepen your understanding of React while working on a practical project is by building a memory game—an engaging challenge that covers key development concepts such as state management, component design, and user interactions.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a fully interactive memory game in React, with a strong emphasis on accessibility. This course, developed by Scrimba, walks you through the entire development process—from fetching API data and designing reusable components to implementing game logic and accessibility best practices. By the end of the course, you'll have a polished, real-world project to showcase your skills.

The course starts by covering the foundational aspects of the game, including fetching and storing API data, rendering dynamic components, and ensuring smooth user interactions. You’ll learn how to retrieve and manage game data, shuffle and randomize game elements, and handle game logic such as detecting matches and tracking progress.

Accessibility is a major focus of this project, ensuring that the game is inclusive and user-friendly. You'll explore key accessibility techniques, including the use of ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation. The course also delves into managing application state effectively, handling errors gracefully, and refactoring components for improved maintainability.

Some of the key topics covered in this course include:

- Fetching and storing API data using React state.
- Rendering and managing dynamic game components.
- Implementing logic for selecting, matching, and shuffling game elements.
- Building reusable components, such as an interactive **EmojiButton**.
- Enhancing accessibility with ARIA attributes and assistive technology considerations.
- Handling errors and improving user experience with dedicated UI components.
- Managing and refactoring form data within React state.

By the end of this course, you'll not only have a fully functional memory game but also a deeper understanding of React development and accessibility principles. Whether you're looking to sharpen your React skills, build a portfolio project, or learn more about inclusive web development, this tutorial is an excellent resource.

Check out the full course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>freeCodeCamp.org](https://youtu.be/MzVbgZgGON4) YouTube channel and start building your own interactive memory game today!
