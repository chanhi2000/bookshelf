Hey there! Have you ever thought about creating your own web server on the cloud? Well, you‚Äôre in for a treat because in this article, we‚Äôre going to explore how you can launch an EC2 instance and use HTTPD to host a simple web server.

Don‚Äôt worry - it‚Äôs simpler than it sounds, and I promise to walk you through it step-by-step with a bit of fun along the way.

By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll feel like a cloud wizard, casting spells that make servers appear out of thin air (well, out of Amazon‚Äôs data centers, but you get the point).

Ready? Let‚Äôs dive in!

## What Is EC2?

Think of EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) as a hotel room in the cloud. Instead of booking a physical server to store your website, you‚Äôre renting one from Amazon‚Äôs magical cloud infrastructure. This room (or instance) comes with all the amenities you need to host a website. Today, we‚Äôll install **HTTPD** (a web server software) in our ‚Äúroom‚Äù to make our website live. üè®‚ú®

## What is HTTPD?

- At its core, HTTPD stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon. Let‚Äôs break that down:
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**: This is the standard protocol used on the web. When you type a URL into your browser or click a link, you‚Äôre using HTTP to tell the server, ‚ÄúHey, send me this web page!‚Äù
- **Daemon (D)**: A daemon is just a fancy term for a background process that runs continuously on a server. In this case, the daemon is responsible for responding to requests from web browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) and sending back the appropriate content.
- So, **HTTPD** is a program that listens for incoming HTTP requests (like when you visit a webpage) and serves back the data (HTML, CSS, images, and so on) needed to display that page.

### HTTPD vs. Apache2: Different Names, Same Game

Depending on your Linux distribution, you may encounter different names for the same basic software:

- On RPM-based distributions (like Red Hat, CentOS, or Fedora), it‚Äôs called httpd.
- On Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu or Debian itself), it‚Äôs referred to as apache2.    

Let‚Äôs look at the steps you can use to launch your EC2 instance, and how to set up a web server using HTTPD.

---

## Step 1: How to Launch Your EC2 Instance

First things first, let‚Äôs launch our EC2 instance. You‚Äôll need an AWS account‚Äîsigning up is free, and AWS offers a free tier, so this won‚Äôt cost you a dime for small-scale experiments.

Head over to the AWS Management Console and log in. From the search bar, type ‚ÄúEC2‚Äù and click on **EC2 Dashboard**.

![EC2 Dashboard](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730267447129/5460a622-b2de-456a-9fae-b757caf37eef.png)

Create a new instance by clicking on the orange **Launch Instance** button.

![Create Instance on AWS](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730345828735/7f2df691-278c-4945-97a6-44e173819eb0.png)

Next, choose the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) by selecting the Amazon Linux AMI, which is free-tier eligible and super reliable. Don‚Äôt forget to give your instance a unique name!

Adding a "Name" tag with a value like "MyFirstInstance" or "ProductionServer" helps you keep track of multiple instances while adding a personal touch to your cloud workspace.

Also, remember to check the default username for the AMI you select. Since you‚Äôve chosen Amazon Linux, the default username is **ec2-user**. Keep this in mind for connecting to your instance later!

![Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and Tags (Name)](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730346031697/3c707686-c8f9-4cdf-aaec-c369722eaea0.png)

**Select an Instance Type**: The t2.micro is your best buddy here again, free-tier eligible and perfect for our needs.

![Instance Type for EC2](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730346372896/b902fd57-e7e3-4144-9186-832b590b3321.png)

**Key Pair for SSH Access**: Here‚Äôs where it gets important to have a <VPIcon icon="fas fa-key"/>`.pem` file to securely connect to your instance. This file, also known as a key pair, acts like the secret key to your cloud ‚Äúhotel room,‚Äù allowing you to log in via SSH.

If you already have a <VPIcon icon="fas fa-key"/>`.pem` file for a previously created key pair, go ahead and choose that from the dropdown menu.

If you don‚Äôt have a <VPIcon icon="fas fa-key"/>`.pem` file, no worries! Create a new key pair by clicking **Create New Key Pair**, and download the <VPIcon icon="fas fa-key"/>`.pem` file to your computer. Make sure to store this file safely‚Äîyou‚Äôll need it to log in, and if you lose it, you won‚Äôt be able to access your EC2 instance!

Why is this file important? The <VPIcon icon="fas fa-key"/>`.pem` file is your private key, and AWS uses it to verify that you are the rightful owner trying to connect to the instance. You won‚Äôt get access without it, just like how you can‚Äôt get into a hotel room without the key.

![Key Pair for AWS EC2](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730346428068/e8d1c913-af2f-40ad-8a80-b2b31af934f4.png)

**Configure Security Group**: AWS EC2 security groups are like virtual firewalls that control traffic in and out of your instance, ensuring only specific types of access. To allow web visitors, set up an HTTP rule on port 80, and for secure server logins, enable SSH on port 22 with restricted IPs.

You can reuse security groups across instances, making configuration easier and more consistent. Regularly review these settings to keep your instance secure and organized.

**Launch the instance**: Boom! You‚Äôve just launched your very own server in the cloud.

![Launch AWS EC2 Instance](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730346693723/9aa28c70-8732-4071-ae03-12d983c6cb15.png)

Wait a minute or two for your instance to come online. Now that we have our EC2 instance running, let‚Äôs move to the next step of setting up our web server.

### Step 2: How to Connect to Your EC2 Instance

To connect, we‚Äôll use the <VPIcon icon="fas fa-key"/>`.pem` file (key pair) we created earlier. If you‚Äôre on a Mac or Linux machine, this is super simple with SSH. For Windows folks, I recommend using **MobaXterm**‚Äîit‚Äôs a user-friendly terminal with SSH built-in.

If you‚Äôre new to connecting EC2 instances using MobaXterm, I‚Äôve written a detailed guide in my previous blog post. You can check it out [here](/freecodecamp.org/connect-to-your-ec2-instance-using-mobaxterm.md), where I show how to set up and connect to an EC2 instance using MobaXterm.

For now, here‚Äôs a quick overview of the connection process using SSH:

```sh
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
```

Replace <VPIcon icon="fas fa-key"/>`your-key.pem` with the name of your key pair and `your-ec2-public-ip` with the public IP of your instance (you can find this in the EC2 dashboard).

If you‚Äôve connected successfully, congratulations! üéâ You‚Äôre inside your cloud server.

### Step 3: How to Install and Start HTTPD (Apache Web Server)

Alright, time to install our web server software (HTTPD)! We‚Äôll be using Apache, one of the most popular web servers around. Don‚Äôt worry, you don‚Äôt need a degree in IT to get this working.

After you successfully connect to your EC2 instance from MobaXterm, you should be all set to start the installation. You‚Äôre just a few commands away from having your web server up and running!

It‚Äôs always good practice to make sure your server is up to date. To update your server, run:

```sh
sudo dnf update -y
```

Next, we‚Äôll install HTTPD (Apache):

```sh
sudo dnf install httpd -y
```

Then start the HTTPD service. Run this command to get the server running.

```sh
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

Next, enable it to start on boot so that every time your EC2 instance reboots, your web server comes back to life automatically.

```sh
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

Time to test it out! Open your browser and type in your instance‚Äôs public IP. If you see the Apache test page, give yourself a high-five. üñêÔ∏è You‚Äôve just launched a web server!

### Step 4: How to Host Your Custom Web Page

Now, let‚Äôs get creative! Instead of the default web server message, let‚Äôs host your very own custom web page in just one step. This will allow you to display a unique message on your site in no time.

Run the following command in your EC2 instance to create and display a simple, personalized web page:

```sh
echo "Welcome to the Cloud! You‚Äôre now hosting your own custom web server using AWS EC2 and Apache!" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

**What does this command do?**

- The `echo` command outputs the text: `"Welcome to the Cloud! You‚Äôre now hosting your own custom web server using AWS EC2 and Apache!"`.
- The `>` symbol redirects this output to a file.
- `/var/www/html/index.html` is the path to the file where the message is saved. This file is the homepage of your web server.

By running this command, you're replacing the default Apache test page with your custom message.

Now, select your EC2 instance, and you‚Äôll find its public IP address. Open your browser, enter that IP, refresh the page, and boom! Your custom message is live on the site. üéâ

Feel free to modify the text to make it uniquely yours!
