When you talk to an AI assistant, it can feel like it remembers what you said before.

But large language models (LLMs) don’t actually have memory on their own. They don’t remember conversations unless that information is given to them again.

So, how do they seem to recall things?

The answer lies in something called a vector store - and that’s what you’ll learn about in this article.

## What Is a Vector Store?

A vector store is a special type of database. Instead of storing text or numbers like a regular database, it stores vectors.

A vector is a list of numbers that represents the meaning of a piece of text. You get these vectors using a process called embedding.

The model takes a sentence and turns it into a high-dimensional point in space. In that space, similar meanings are close together.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1746419405154/214a0566-8dc6-4402-a0f1-e30f8d81003c.png)

For example, if I embed “I love sushi,” it might be close to “Sushi is my favourite food” in vector space. These embeddings help an AI agent find related thoughts even if the exact words differ.

---

## How Embeddings Work

Let’s say a user tells an assistant:

```plaintext
“I live in Austin, Texas.”
```

The model turns this sentence into a vector:

```plaintext
[0.23, -0.41, 0.77, ..., 0.08]
```

This vector doesn’t mean much to us, but to the AI, it’s a way to capture the sentence’s meaning. That vector gets stored in a vector database, along with some extra info - maybe a timestamp or a note that it came from this user.

Later, if the user says:

```plaintext
“Book a flight to my hometown.”
```

The model turns this new sentence into a new vector. It then searches the vector database to find the most similar stored vectors.

The closest match might be “I live in Austin, Texas.” Now the AI knows what you probably meant by “my hometown.”

This ability to look up related past inputs based on meaning - not just matching keywords - is what gives LLMs a form of memory.

## Why Vector Stores Are Crucial for Memory

LLMs process language using a context window. That’s the amount of text they can “see” at once.

For GPT-4-turbo, the window can handle up to 128,000 tokens, which sounds huge - but even that gets filled fast. You can’t keep the whole conversation there forever.

Instead, you use a vector store as long-term memory. You embed and save useful info.

Then, when needed, you query the vector store, retrieve the top relevant pieces, and feed them back into the LLM. This way, the model remembers just enough to act smart - without holding everything in its short-term memory.

## Popular Vector Stores

There are several popular vector databases in use. Each one has its strengths.

### FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

<SiteInfo
  name="Faiss"
  desc="A library that allows developers to quickly search for embeddings of multimedia documents that are similar to each other."
  url="https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/"
  logo="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v4/y4/r/WUJbsVI4ruF.png"
  preview="https://scontent-icn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/91980731_255741849160254_7676025225686810624_n.png?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=e280be&_nc_ohc=UQC6M4FR9tkQ7kNvwHader2&_nc_oc=AdkNq8tUgHvNxSWIoQETgVEWaWdSS9rSnU8cr-6i_fG0NhKsa1K1KZAn7mkzBvsUpaE&_nc_zt=14&_nc_ht=scontent-icn2-1.xx&_nc_gid=cGySecpnfqVsb73-6yOd0w&oh=00_AfQW_e6qhRRzi22NOOURRWbr4XKbt0aVDkhXDivRBhq39A&oe=6895346C"/>

FAISS is an open-source library developed by Meta. It’s fast and works well for local or on-premise applications.

FAISS is great if you want full control and don’t need cloud hosting. It supports millions of vectors and provides tools for indexing and searching with high performance.

Here’s how you can use FAISS:

```py
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np
```

```py :collapsed-lines
# Load a pre-trained sentence transformer model that converts sentences to numerical vectors (embeddings)
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Define the input sentence we want to store in memory
sentence = "User lives in Austin, Texas"

# Convert the sentence into a dense vector (embedding)
embedding = model.encode(sentence)

# Get the dimensionality of the embedding vector (needed to create the FAISS index)
dimension = embedding.shape[0]

# Create a FAISS index for L2 (Euclidean) similarity search using the embedding dimension
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Add the sentence embedding to the FAISS index (this is our "memory")
index.add(np.array([embedding]))

# Encode a new query sentence that we want to match against the stored memory
query = model.encode("Where is the user from?")

# Search the FAISS index for the top-1 most similar vector to the query
D, I = index.search(np.array([query]), k=1)

# Print the index of the most relevant memory (in this case, only one item in the index)
print("Most relevant memory index:", I[0][0])
```

This code uses a pre-trained model to turn a sentence like “User lives in Austin, Texas” into an embedding.

It stores this embedding in a FAISS index. When you ask a question like “Where is the user from?”, the code converts that question into another embedding and searches the index to find the stored sentence that’s most similar in meaning.

Finally, it prints the position (index) of the most relevant sentence in the memory.

FAISS is efficient, but it’s not hosted. That means you need to manage your own infrastructure.

### Pinecone

<SiteInfo
  name="The vector database to build knowledgeable AI | Pinecone"
  desc="Search through billions of items for similar matches to any object, in milliseconds. It’s the next generation of search, an API call away."
  url="https://pinecone.io"
  logo="https://pinecone.io/favicon.ico"
  preview="https://pinecone.io/images/ogimage-general.jpg"/>

Pinecone is a cloud-native vector database. It’s managed for you, which makes it great for production systems.

You don’t need to worry about scaling or maintaining servers. Pinecone handles billions of vectors and offers filtering, metadata support, and fast queries. It integrates well with tools like LangChain and OpenAI.

Here’s how a basic Pinecone setup works:

```py
import pinecone
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
```

```py :collapsed-lines
# Initialize Pinecone with your API key and environment
pinecone.init(api_key="your-api-key", environment="us-west1-gcp")

# Connect to or create a Pinecone index named "memory-store"
index = pinecone.Index("memory-store")

# Load a pre-trained sentence transformer model to convert text into embeddings
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Convert a fact/sentence into a numerical embedding (vector)
embedding = model.encode("User prefers vegetarian food")

# Store (upsert) the embedding into Pinecone with a unique ID
index.upsert([("user-pref-001", embedding.tolist())])

# Encode the query sentence into an embedding
query = model.encode("What kind of food does the user like?")

# Search Pinecone to find the most relevant stored embedding for the query
results = index.query(queries=[query.tolist()], top_k=1)

# Print the ID of the top matching memory
print("Top match ID:", results['matches'][0]['id'])
```

Pinecone is ideal if you want scalability and ease of use without managing hardware.

Other popular vector stores include:

- [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Weaviate](https://weaviate.io) - Combines vector search with knowledge graphs. Offers strong semantic search with hybrid keyword support.
- [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Chroma](https://trychroma.com) - Simple to use and good for prototyping. Often used in personal apps or demos.
- [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech) - Open-source and built for high-performance vector search with filtering.

Each of these has its place depending on whether you need speed, scale, simplicity, or special features.

## Making AI Seem Smart with Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This whole system - embedding user inputs, storing them in a vector database, and retrieving them later - is called [**retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**](/freecodecamp.org/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-handbook/README.md).

The AI still doesn’t have a brain, but it can act like it does. You choose what to remember, when to recall it, and how to feed it back into the conversation.

If the AI helps a user track project updates, you can store each project detail as a vector. When the user later asks, “What’s the status of the design phase?” you search your memory database, pull the most relevant notes, and let the LLM stitch them into a helpful answer.

## The Limits of Vector-Based Memory

While vector stores give AI agents a powerful way to simulate memory, this approach comes with some important limitations.

Vector search is based on similarity, not true understanding. That means the most similar stored embedding may not always be the most relevant or helpful in context. For instance, two sentences might be mathematically close in vector space but carry very different meanings. As a result, the AI can sometimes surface confusing or off-topic results, especially when nuance or emotional tone is involved.

Another challenge is that embeddings are static snapshots. Once stored, they don’t evolve or adapt unless explicitly updated. If a user changes their mind or provides new information, the system won’t "learn" unless the original vector is removed or replaced. Unlike human memory, which adapts and refines itself over time, vector-based memory is frozen unless developers actively manage it.

There are a few ways you can mitigate these challenges.

One is to include more context in the retrieval process, such as filtering results by metadata like timestamps, topics, or user intent. This helps narrow down results to what’s truly relevant at the moment.

Another approach is to reprocess or re-embed older memories periodically, ensuring that the information reflects the most current understanding of the user’s needs or preferences.

Beyond technical limitations, vector stores also raise privacy and ethical concerns. Key questions are: Who decides what gets saved? How long should that memory persist? And does the user have control over what is remembered or forgotten?

Ideally, these decisions should not be made solely by the developer or system. A more thoughtful approach is to make memory explicit. Let users choose what gets remembered. For example, by marking certain inputs as “important”, it adds a layer of consent and transparency. Similarly, memory retention should be time-bound where appropriate, with expiration policies based on how long the information remains useful.

Equally important is the ability for users to view, manage, or delete their stored data. Whether through a simple interface or a programmatic API, memory management tools are essential for trust. As the use of vector stores expands, so does the expectation that AI systems will respect user agency and privacy.

The broader AI community is still shaping best practices around these issues. But one thing is clear: simulated memory should be designed not just for accuracy and performance, but for accountability. By combining strong defaults with user control, developers can ensure vector-based memory systems are both smart and responsible.

## Conclusion

Vector stores give AI agents a way to fake memory - and they do it well. By embedding text into vectors and using tools like FAISS or Pinecone, we give models the power to recall what matters. It’s not real memory. But it makes AI systems feel more personal, more helpful, and more human.

As these tools grow more advanced, so does the illusion. But behind every smart AI is a simple system of vectors and similarity. If you can master that, you can build assistants that remember, learn, and improve with time.
