In the rapidly evolving landscape of cross-platform development, a new player has emerged that promises to revolutionize the way developers create applications: Lynx. Developed by ByteDance, the company behind TikTok, Lynx is an open-source framework designed to enable the creation of native, cross-platform mobile applications using familiar web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What sets Lynx apart is its focus on delivering native performance through a dual-threaded architecture and its seamless integration with existing web development practices.

We just published a course on the [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"/>freeCodeCamp.org](http://freeCodeCamp.org) YouTube channel that will teach you all about building a game search application using Lynx. This comprehensive course, created by Brijen Makwana, guides you through setting up a Lynx project, implementing API integration, and mastering Lynx's unique dual-thread architecture for optimal performance. Throughout the tutorial, you'll gain essential insights into Lynx's UI components, state management with TanStack Query, and navigation implementation using React Router.

Lynx offers several compelling features that make it an attractive choice for developers:

- **Native Rendering Across Platforms**: Lynx enables native rendering on Android, iOS, and Web platforms, ensuring consistent and high-performance user experiences.
- **Performance at Scale**: With its multithreaded engine, Lynx achieves instant launch times and smooth UI responsiveness, even in complex applications.
- **Web-Inspired Design**: Developers can leverage their existing knowledge of CSS and React, as Lynx is designed with web technologies in mind, offering full support for CSS animations, transitions, selectors, and variables for theming.
- **Dual-Threaded Architecture**: Lynx introduces a dual-threaded UI rendering engine, where the main thread handles rendering and high-priority tasks, while a background thread manages user code. This separation enhances performance and ensures responsive interactions.

In this course, you'll embark on building a video game search mobile application from scratch. The curriculum includes:

- Initializing the project and setting up the Lynx Explorer App for testing.
- Understanding the project structure and setting up Lynx Dev Tools.
- Creating components such as GameCard and GameCategory.
- Integrating with the IGDB API, including testing with Postman and setting up TanStack Query for state management.
- Implementing navigation using React Router and handling various screens like Game Details, Game Events, and Game Search.
- Adding CSS animations and understanding how to run code in the main thread due to Lynx's dual-thread architecture.

By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of how to build high-performance, cross-platform applications using Lynx, and you'll be well-equipped to leverage this knowledge in your own projects.

To get started, watch the full course on [<VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-youtube"/>the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/KCQsP91Wor0) (3-hour watch):
