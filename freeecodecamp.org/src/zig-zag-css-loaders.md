In [a previous article](/freecodecamp.org/filling-css-loaders.md), I showed you how to create filling CSS loaders collection where each loader was built using a single HTML element. Here, you’ll learn more about loaders by creating [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>the Zig-Zag collection](https://css-loaders.com/zig-zag/).

Here is an overview of what you’ll be building:

You can also check [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>my online collection](https://css-loaders.com/zig-zag/) to see up to 20 variations using a zig-zag shape.

We won’t study all the variations but I will show you a few tricks that’ll help you create as many variations as you want.

## How to Create a Zig-Zag Shape

The first step is to create a zig-zag shape. For this, you can grab the code from my CSS shape website: 

<SiteInfo
  name="CSS Shape: Zig-Zag Line"
  desc="A CSS-only Zig-Zag Line shape made with a single-element and modern CSS."
  url="https://css-shape.com/zig-zag-line/"
  logo="https://css-shape.com/fav.png"
  preview="zig-zag-line.jpg"/>

![Zig-Zag shape from css-shape.com](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731707755150/f1782db9-fa7f-472e-b771-cfc1c2046e0c.png)

You can adjust the different variables to get the zig-zag you want. In our case, I will use an easier version with no variables.

```css
.loader {
  height: 47px; /* control the size */
  aspect-ratio: 5;
  background:
    conic-gradient(from 135deg at top,#000 90deg,#0000 0) top,
    conic-gradient(from 135deg at top,#0000 90deg,#000 0) bottom;
  background-size: 20% 50%;
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
```

And here is a figure to illustrate how those gradients create the shape:

![Color gradients created by the code](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1731708477342/bbe3e0b6-24a2-498d-992b-4ee152b0d74c.png)

The first gradient created the red part while the second one created the green part. We have two triangle shapes that repeat horizontally.

Since we have five repetitions, I used `aspect-ratio: 5` and `20% (100%/5)` in the `background-size`. You can make it more generic by introducing a variable to control the number of repetitions but as I said previously, I am going to keep things simple.

I want to point out that when using gradients, you can achieve the same result by using different syntaxes. For example, I can update the previous code with the following:

```css
.loader {
  height: 47px; /* control the size */
  aspect-ratio: 5;
  background:
   conic-gradient(from 135deg at top   ,#000 90deg,#0000 0),
   conic-gradient(from -45deg at bottom,#000 90deg,#0000 0) 12.5% 100%;
  background-size: 20% 50%;
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
```

It’s still the same output but with a different syntax for the second gradient. Did you notice the repeated part within the gradients? That part controls the coloration and we can define it as a variable to avoid repetition and be able to update the color only once in the code.

```css
.loader {
  height: 47px; /* control the size */
  aspect-ratio: 5;
  --c:#000 /* the color */ 90deg,#0000 0;
  background:
   conic-gradient(from 135deg at top   ,var(--c)),
   conic-gradient(from -45deg at bottom,var(--c)) 12.5% 100%;
  background-size: 20% 50%;
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
```

Now we have our zig-zag shape and we are ready to animate it.

---

## How to Animate the Zig-Zag Shape

Since we’re using a background, we’ll animate the `background-position` to get our first loader. The idea is to move the gradients horizontally and create an infinite movement.

```css
.loader {
   height: 47px; /* control the size */
   aspect-ratio: 5;
   --c:#000 /* the color */ 90deg,#0000 0;
   background:
     conic-gradient(from 135deg at top   ,var(--c)),
     conic-gradient(from -45deg at bottom,var(--c)) 12.5% 100%;
   background-size: 20% 50%;
   background-repeat: repeat-x;
   animation: loading .8s infinite linear;
}

@keyframes loading {
  0%   {background-position: 0   0,12.5% 100%}
  100% {background-position: 25% 0,37.5% 100%}
}
```

Note how we increased the X value of the `background-position` by `25%`. In case you are wondering what the logic behind that value is, here is the formula:

$$
\frac{0.2}{1-0.2)}=.25=25\%
$$

`.2` corresponds to the `20%` used inside the `background-size`.

<CodePen

  slug-hash="poMBgQO"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

We have our first loader! Actually, two loaders because we can easily change the direction of the movement by adding `animation-direction: reverse`.

Let’s try a different animation: using `clip-path` and the `inset()` value. We can easily adjust this technique to create many variations.

Let’s start with a basic example:

```css
.loader {
  /* same code as previously */
  animation: loading .8s infinite linear;
}
@keyframes loading {
  0%   {clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0)}
  100% {clip-path: inset(0 0    0 0)}
}
```

The `inset()` value creates a rectangle where only the part inside it will be visible. For this, we define a distance from each side of the element (top, right, bottom, left).

Logically, `inset(0 0 0 0)` shows the whole element since all the distances are equal to 0, but `inset(0 100% 0 0)` completely hides the element since the right value is equal to 100%. So it will touch the opposite edge, creating an empty rectangle.

By animating that right value from `100%` to `0` we create a reveal animation. Another loader variation!

<CodePen
  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="WNVWrVy"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

If you inspect the code of the second animation, you will see that I did the same thing but with the left side.

We can also have a sliding effect if we animate both the left and right values while keeping their difference constant.

```css
.loader {
  /* same code as previously */
  animation: loading .8s infinite linear;
}
@keyframes loading {
  0%   {clip-path: inset(0 60% 0 0  )}
  100% {clip-path: inset(0 0   0 60%)}
}
```

The right value animates from `60%` to `0` and the left one from `0` to `60%`, so we have a constant difference equal to `60%` which will create the illusion of a sliding rectangle. Another cool loader!

  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="wvVZGwy"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

By trying different combinations of `inset()` values, you can get a lot of CSS loaders. Give it a try! You can also check [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>my online collection](https://css-loaders.com/zig-zag/) and try to identify the variations that use `clip-path: inset()`.

## How to Create a Discrete Animation

To achieve a discrete animation, you can use the `steps()` timing function instead of `linear`. Let’s start with the first example using `steps(2)`.

<CodePen
  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="YzmbzGL"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

We can do the same with almost all the variations. Let’s try with the ones that use `clip-path: inset()`.

```css
.loader {
  /* same code as previously */
  animation: loading .8s infinite steps(5);
}
@keyframes loading {
  0%   {clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0)}
  100% {clip-path: inset(0 0    0 0)}
}
```

We have five repetitions so let’s see what we’ll get with `steps(5)`.

<CodePen
  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="JjgqjNr"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

At the moment, it’s not good because we don’t see all the repetition. The animation stops at 4 repetitions, but we need to see the whole element (5 repetitions). The count starts from 0 so what we really need is 6 steps instead of 5 to show all the repetitions.

```css
.loader {
  /* same code as previously */
  animation: loading .8s infinite steps(6);
}
@keyframes loading {
  0%   {clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0)}
  100% {clip-path: inset(0 0    0 0)}
}
```

<CodePen
  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="RwXmKje"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

Even with 6 steps, the result is still not good but don’t worry, it’s not a bug. The default behavior of `steps()` gives us that output but we can update it to get the expected output:

```css
.loader {
  /* same code as previously */
  animation: loading .8s infinite steps(6,jump-none);
}
@keyframes loading {
  0%   {clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0)}
  100% {clip-path: inset(0 0    0 0)}
}
```

If you’re not familiar with `jump-none`, it’s a value that can fix most of your issues when working with `steps()`. I wrote a short article about it if you want more details: “[<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>How to correctly use steps() with animations](https://css-tip.com/steps/)“

<CodePen
  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="JjgqEpO"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

Our animation looks perfect now! We can also make it an 11-step animation (`5×2 + 1`) and get another cool loader.

<CodePen
  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="vYowgRV"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

Even the sliding effect can have its discrete variation.

<CodePen
  user="t_afif"
  slug-hash="bGXyZpO"
  title="Untitled"
  :default-tab="['css','result']"
  :theme="$isDarkmode ? 'dark': 'light'"/>

Can you figure out why I am using 4 and 7 steps? I’ll let you do the calculation as a small exercise.
