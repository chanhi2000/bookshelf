## How to Start Using ZenUI

One of the key advantages of ZenUI is that you don’t need to install anything to start using it. ZenUI provides all the necessary **HTML structure** and **Tailwind CSS classes** directly in its documentation, allowing you to copy and paste the code into your projects without any additional setup.

If you're working with frameworks like **React** or **Next.js**, all you need is a project that has Tailwind CSS integrated. You can simply copy the component or block code and paste it directly into your JSX, and you’re ready to go. There’s no need to install external dependencies or packages.

ZenUI makes it easy to kickstart your project without any friction—just start a project with React or Next.js, integrate Tailwind CSS, and start building with ZenUI’s pre-built components and blocks.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to get started using the ZenUI Library:

### 1. Visit the ZenUI Library Website

Head over to the [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-globe"/>ZenUI Library website](https://zenuilibrary.com) where you can browse through a wide variety of UI components, templates, essential blocks, and SVG icons. ZenUI Library offers everything from simple buttons to more complex layouts.

### 2. Browse and Select a Component

Once on the website, explore the different sections for components like:

- Buttons
- Forms
- Modals
- Navigation Bars
- Cards
- Alert, and more.

Each component is showcased with a live preview, making it easier to find exactly what you need for your project.

### 3. Copy the Component Code

Every component listed in the ZenUI Library has an associated code section.

**You don’t need to install any dependencies** - simply **copy the JSX Code** for the selected component.

### 4. Integrate the Code into Your Project

After selecting a component from the ZenUI Library website and copying the code, integrating it into your project is incredibly simple:

**Paste the Code**:

- **React or Next.js Project**: Open your desired component file (for example, <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-react"/>`App.js` any other component file) and **paste** the copied code directly into the file where you want to paste it.
- **Tailwind CSS Project**: If you’re using plain HTML with Tailwind CSS, paste just the HTML code from ZenUI Library into your HTML file.

**Done!** You’re all set. You can now see the component on your project without needing to install any dependencies or extra packages.

ZenUI Library components are designed to work out of the box, so after pasting the code, you will immediately see the component functioning on your project.

### 5. Customize Components

All components and templates in the ZenUI Library are **highly customizable**. You can change colors, sizes, and layouts using Tailwind or modify the HTML structure to fit your unique needs. Whether you are building a light or dark theme, ZenUI offers complete flexibility.

I’ll walk you through customizing a card component step by step below.

### 6. Start Building with ZenUI Components

Now that the components are integrated, you can focus on building the rest of your application. The pre-built, responsive, and reusable ZenUI components will speed up your development process without sacrificing design quality.

By following these steps, you can start using ZenUI Library right away in your project. Whether you’re building with React, Next.js, or plain HTML with Tailwind CSS, ZenUI Library offers a simple and effective solution for UI development without the hassle of managing additional dependencies.

## How to Customize ZenUI Components

Here's a detailed breakdown of how you can customize a **card component** in the ZenUI Library using Tailwind CSS. This will cover changing colors, adjusting sizes, and modifying the layout to fit your project's look and feel.

### Original Card Component

This is a basic card component using Tailwind CSS:

```html
<div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-t-lg">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Card Title</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">This is a customizable card component.</p>
  <button class="mt-4 bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Learn More</button>
</div>
```

### 1. Customize Colors

You can easily change the background colors, text colors, and button colors by modifying the Tailwind classes.

#### Changing Background and Text Colors for Dark Mode

To make the card compatible with dark mode, you'll want to adjust the background and text colors. Here’s the code you can use to do that:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-t-lg">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Card Title</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2">This is a customizable card component.</p>
  <button class="mt-4 bg-blue-500 dark:bg-yellow-500 text-white dark:text-gray-900 px-4 py-2 rounded">Learn More</button>
</div>
```

**Code breakdown:**

- `dark:bg-gray-800`: Changes the background color to dark gray when dark mode is active.
- `dark:text-white`: Sets the text color to white in dark mode for the title.
- `dark:text-gray-400`: Lightens the paragraph text in dark mode for better readability.
- `dark:bg-yellow-500`: Changes the button background to yellow in dark mode.
- `dark:text-gray-900`: Changes the button text color to dark gray in dark mode

### 2. Configure <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-js"/>`tailwind.config.js` to Enable Dark Mode

To enable **dark mode** in your Tailwind CSS project, you need to configure two main things:

1. Set up the <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-js"/>`tailwind.config.js` file to enable dark mode.
2. Adjust your HTML to toggle dark mode on and off.

Let’s walk through the process step-by-step.

In the <VPIcon icon="fa-brands fa-js"/>`tailwind.config.js` file, add the `darkMode` option. Tailwind CSS supports two strategies for dark mode:

- `'media'`: Uses the user's system preference (light or dark mode).
- `'class'`: Uses a `dark` class that you can toggle manually (gives you more control).

::: info Example Configuration Using the `'class'` Strategy:

```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class', // Enable class-based dark mode
  // Other configurations...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      // Customizations...
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      // Variants...
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

:::

#### Set Up Your HTML to Toggle Dark Mode

::: tabs

@tab:active 1.

**For Class-Based Dark Mode** (`darkMode: 'class'`): To control dark mode manually, you need to add or remove the `dark` class on your root HTML element.

**Add the** `dark` Class to Enable Dark Mode:

```html
<html class="dark">
  <head>
    <!-- Head content -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

@tab 2.

**Toggle Dark Mode with JavaScript:** You can also add a button to toggle dark mode dynamically:

```html
<button onclick="toggleDarkMode()">Toggle Dark Mode</button>

<script>
  function toggleDarkMode() {
    document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark');
  }
</script>
```

:::

#### Summary

- **Step 1:** In your `tailwind.config.js` file set `darkMode` to `'class'` or `'media'`.
  - Use `'class'` if you want to toggle dark mode manually.
  - Use `'media'` to automatically follow the user's system preference.
- **Step 2:** If using `'class'` mode, add or remove the `dark` class on your `<html>` or `<body>` tag to enable or disable dark mode.
- **Step 3:** In your HTML, use the `dark:` prefix in Tailwind CSS classes to specify styles for dark mode.

### 3. Customize Sizes and Spacing

You can modify the size of the card and adjust the padding and margins to better fit your layout.

#### Larger Card with More Padding

If you want a larger card with more padding and a bigger image:

```html
<div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-10">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-t-lg">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8">Card Title</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">This is a customizable card component.</p>
  <button class="mt-8 bg-blue-500 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg">Learn More</button>
</div>
```

**Code breakdown:**

- `p-10` increases the padding inside the card for a more spacious layout.
- `h-64` changes the image height to 64 units (16rem), making it taller.
- `mt-8` adds more space between elements, like the title and button.
- `px-6 py-3` increases the padding inside the button, making it larger.
- `rounded-lg` adds larger, more prominent rounded corners to the button.

### 4. Modify the Layout

You can also adjust the card layout by making it more compact or aligning content differently.

#### Compact Card with Left-Aligned Content

```html
<div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-4 flex items-start">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="w-24 h-24 object-cover rounded-lg mr-4">
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Card Title</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2">This is a customizable card component.</p>
    <button class="mt-4 bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Learn More</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Code breakdown:**

- `flex items-start` makes the card a flexible box layout with content aligned to the top.
- `w-24 h-24` resizes the image to a smaller, square format.
- `mr-4` adds a margin to the right of the image, separating it from the text content.
- The rest of the content (title, text, and button) is contained in a `div` to keep it aligned next to the image.

### 5. Customize it with Responsive Design

Tailwind makes it easy to customize the card for different screen sizes.

#### Responsive Card for Mobile and Desktop

```html
<div class="bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-6 md:p-10">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" class="w-full h-48 md:h-64 object-cover rounded-t-lg">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 md:mt-8">Card Title</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mt-2 md:mt-4">This is a customizable card component.</p>
  <button class="mt-4 md:mt-8 bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 md:px-6 md:py-3 rounded-lg">Learn More</button>
</div>
```

**Code breakdown:**

- `md:p-10` increases the padding on larger screens (for example, tablets or desktops).
- `md:h-64` makes the image taller on larger screens, providing a better visual experience.
- `md:mt-8` adds more spacing between elements on larger screens to prevent a cramped look.
- `md:px-6 md:py-3` enlarges the button on larger screens, making it easier to interact with.

As you’ve just seen, with Tailwind CSS, you can customize ZenUI Library components in various ways:

1. **Colors:** Adjust background, text, and button colors for light and dark themes.
2. **Sizes & Spacing:** Modify padding, margins, and dimensions to fit your layout.
3. **Layout:** Use a flexbox or grid to alter how content is arranged within the card.
4. **Responsive Design:** Tailor your components for different screen sizes using responsive utility classes.

## How to Use ZenUI Website Templates

Getting started with **ZenUI’s Website Templates** is quick and easy. I’ll now walk you through setting up your project using one of ZenUI’s pre-built templates.

### Step 1: Choose a Template

Head over to the **ZenUI Library website** and navigate to the templates section. You’ll find a variety of website templates.

- Pick a template that fits your project needs.
- Go to the template GitHub repository by clicking the **Get Template** button.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository on Your Desktop

When you go to the GitHub repository by clicking the **Get Template** button, you will see a button called **Code**. Click on it you will see an HTTPS URL like the below picture. Copy the URL.

![clone-zenui-template-from-github-repository](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727202543195/e1c05f17-b12f-4ab3-9b9d-23cebd948349.png)

After copying the HTTPS URL just open your computer `terminal` and type a command like the one below:

```sh
git clone <PROJECT-HTTPS-URL-HERE>
```

After processing the command with the correct HTTPS URL, you will get the template on your local computer. Now open the template project on a code editor of your choice.

After opening the project in your code editor, you need to do just 2 things:

- Install the npm packages using the command `npm install` (packages will be react-icons, react-router-dom, and so on)
