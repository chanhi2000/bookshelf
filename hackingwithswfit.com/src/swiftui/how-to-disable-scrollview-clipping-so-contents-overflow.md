**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI's `ScrollView` automatically clips its contents, so that scrolling views always stay fully inside the scroll view area. However, if you use the `scrollClipDisabled()` modifier you can override this default behavior, allowing scrolling views to overflow.

::: important

This does not affect the touch area of the scroll view, so if users tap on views that have overflowed your `ScrollView` that tap will actually be received by whatever is below. So, it's probably best to restrict this a little, for example to allow shadows to flow outside the scrolling area without affecting other views too much.

:::

As an example, this next example shows a `VStack` with fixed text at the top and bottom, with a scrolling area in the middle. The scrolling views will start neatly aligned below the top text, but as you scroll will overflow:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Fixed at the top")
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .frame(height: 100)
        .background(.green)
        .foregroundStyle(.white)

    ScrollView {
        ForEach(0..<5) { i in
            Text("Scrolling")
                .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                .frame(height: 200)
                .background(.blue)
                .foregroundStyle(.white)
        }
    }
    .scrollClipDisabled()

    Text("Fixed at the bottom")
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .frame(height: 100)
        .background(.green)
        .foregroundStyle(.white)
}
```

There are two extra things it's helpful to know when working with `scrollClipDisabled()`:

1. You can add a custom clip shape to limit how far things overflow. For example, adding `padding()` then `clipShape(.rect)` means you get a little overflow, but not infinite.
2. Because scrolling views now overlap their surroundings, you may need to use `zIndex()` to adjust their vertical positioning. For example, if other views have the default Z index, then using `zIndex(1)` on your scroll view will make its children render over other views.
