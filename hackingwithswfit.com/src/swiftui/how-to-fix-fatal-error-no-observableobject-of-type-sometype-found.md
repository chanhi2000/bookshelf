When you’re using environment objects, SwiftUI automatically connects your properties by scanning the environment for matching types. So, if you have an environment property of type `User`, SwiftUI expects to find an instance of that class in the environment before it is used.

This error occurs because no matching object could be found, which is usually a result of you forgetting to put it into the environment, or putting it into the *wrong* environment. Remember, you can have multiple environments active in your SwiftUI app: you might have individual environments for each of the tabs in a `TabView` for example.

To fix the problem, make sure the view that causes the crash has the correct environment set, like this:

```swift
YourView().environmentObject(yourEnvironmentObject)
```
