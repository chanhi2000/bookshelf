SwiftUI gives us a specific property wrapper for tracking the state of gestures, helpfully called `@GestureState`. Although you can accomplish the same using a simple `@State` property wrapper, `@GestureState` comes with the added ability that it automatically sets your property back to its initial value when the gesture ends, and it’s usually significantly *faster* than using a simple `@State` as well.

For example, we might want to create a gesture that can drag views around. To do that, we’d first need to create an `@GestureState` property to store how much the view has been moved, like this:

```swift
@GestureState var dragAmount = CGSize.zero
```

That has the default value of `CGSize.zero`, which means when the gesture ends it will return to that value automatically.

Next, we would attach an `offset()` modifier so that our view gets moved around by whatever value is in `dragAmount`:

```swift
Image("niagara-falls")
    .offset(dragAmount)
```

Finally, we would attach a gesture that is bound to our `dragAmount` property, like this:

```swift
Image("niagara-falls")
    .offset(dragAmount)
    .gesture(
        DragGesture().updating($dragAmount) { value, state, transaction in
            state = value.translation
        }
    )
```

There’s quite a lot of code in there, so let’s unpack it:

1. The `DragGesture().updating()` code creates a new drag gesture, asking it to modify the value stored in `dragAmount` - that’s our `CGSize`.
2. It takes a closure with three parameters: `value`, `state`, and `transaction`.
3. The `value` parameter is the current data for the drag - where it started, how far it’s moved, where it’s predicted to end, and so on.
4. The `state` parameter is an `inout` value that is our property. So, rather than reading or writing `dragAmount` directly, inside this closure we should modify `state`.
5. The `transaction` parameter is an `inout` value that stores the whole animation context, giving us a little information about what’s going on such as whether this is a continuous or transient animation. Continuous animations might be produced by dragging a slider, whereas transient animations might be produced by tapping a button.
6. To make our view draggable, all we do is assign the current translation the drag straight to `state` (which is really `dragAmount` in this case), which in turn is used in the `offset()` modifier to move the view.

Remember, one of the advantages of `@GestureState` is that it automatically sets the value of your property back to its initial value when the gesture ends. In this case, it means we can drag a view around all we want, and as soon as we let go it will snap back to its original position.
