> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI's `refreshable()` modifier lets you attach functionality to a `List` to be triggered when the user drags down far enough. iOS will automatically show an activity indicator for as long as it takes for your code to finish running.

To get started, simply add a `refreshable()` modifier to your list where you do your work, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List(1..<100) { row in
                Text("Row \(row)")
            }
            .refreshable {
                print("Do your refresh work here")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The code you place inside `refreshable()` is already running in an async context, so it's the perfect place to put something like networking. For example, here's a complete example that uses pull to refresh to download some news stories into a `List`:

```swift
struct NewsItem: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let strap: String
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var news = [
        NewsItem(id: 0, title: "Want the latest news?", strap: "Pull to refresh!")
    ]

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List(news) { item in
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(item.title)
                        .font(.headline)
                    Text(item.strap)
                        .foregroundStyle(.secondary)
                }
            }
            .refreshable {
                do {
                    // Fetch and decode JSON into news items
                    let url = URL(string: "https://hackingwithswift.com/samples/news-1.json")!
                    let url = URL(string: "https://hackingwithswift.com/samples/news-1.json")!
                    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
                    news = try JSONDecoder().decode([NewsItem].self, from: data)
                } catch {
                    // Something went wrong; clear the news
                    news = []
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
