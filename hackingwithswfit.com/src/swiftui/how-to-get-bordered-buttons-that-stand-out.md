> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI has a dedicated `.bordered` button style that mimics a common look and feel used across many of Apple's apps. In its most basic form it looks like this:

```swift
Button("Buy: $0.99") {
    print("Buying…")
}
.buttonStyle(.bordered)
```

However, for buttons that should really stand out on the screen, you are likely to want to use the `borderedProminent` option to make their color much stronger:

```swift
Button("Buy: $0.99") {
    print("Buying for $0.99")
}
.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
```

::: important

Having lots of prominent buttons is not good UI practice.

:::

You can customize the color of these buttons either by using `tint()`:

```swift
Button("Submit") {
    print("Submitting…")
}
.tint(.indigo)
.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
```

![A deep blue capsule containing the text “Submit”.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-get-bordered-buttons-that-stand-out-3~dark.png)

Or by attaching a role to the button:

```swift
Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
    print("Deleting…")
}
.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
```
