> Updated for Xcode 15

**Improved in iOS 17**

SwiftUI has built-in support for animations with its `animation()` modifier. To use this modifier, place it after any other modifiers for your views, tell it what kind of animation you want, and also make sure you attach it to a particular value so the animation triggers only when that specific value changes.

For example, this code creates a button that increases its scale effect by 1 each time it’s pressed:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scale = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Press here") {
            scale += 1
        }
        .scaleEffect(scale)
        .animation(.linear(duration: 1), value: scale)
    }
}
```

That makes the animation happen over 1 second, but if you don’t want to specify a precise time for your animation you can just use `.linear`.

::: important

From iOS 17 and later SwiftUI uses spring animations by default, but before that used linear animations by default.

:::

Instead of simple linear animations you can specify a curve from various built-in options, including:

- `.easeIn` starts slow then accelerates until the end.
- `.easeOut` starts fast then slows down near the end.
- `.easeInOut` starts slow, accelerates in the middle, then slows down near the end.
- `.smooth` is a spring animation with no bounce (from iOS 17) 
- `.snappy` is a spring animation with a little bounce (from iOS 17)
- `.bouncy` is a spring animation with a medium amount of bounce (from iOS 17)

Alternatively, you can specify `.timingCurve` to specify your own control points.

For example, this animates the scale effect so that it starts slow and gets faster:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var scale = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Press here") {
            scale += 1
        }
        .scaleEffect(scale)
        .animation(.easeIn, value: scale)
    }
}
```

You can animate many other modifiers, such as 2D and 3D rotation, opacity, border, and more. For example, this makes a button that spins around and increases its border every time it’s tapped:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var angle = 0.0
    @State private var borderThickness = 1.0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Press here") {
            angle += 45
            borderThickness += 1
        }
        .padding()
        .border(.red, width: borderThickness)
        .rotationEffect(.degrees(angle))
        .animation(.easeIn, value: angle)
    }
}
```
