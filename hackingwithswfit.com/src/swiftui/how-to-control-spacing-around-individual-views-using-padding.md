> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI lets us set individual padding around views using the `padding()` modifier, causing views to be placed further away from their neighbors.

If you use this with no parameters you'll get system-default padding on all sides, like this:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Using")
    Text("SwiftUI")
        .padding()
    Text("rocks")
}
```

> [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-zipper"/>Download this as an Xcode project](https://hackingwithswift.com/files/projects/swiftui/how-to-control-spacing-around-individual-views-using-padding-1.zip)

The text “Using” and “SwiftUI” placed some distance above the text “rocks”.

But you can also customize how much padding to apply and where. So, you might want to apply system padding to only one side:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Using")
    Text("SwiftUI")
        .padding(.bottom)
    Text("rocks")
}
```

> [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-zipper"/>Download this as an Xcode project](https://hackingwithswift.com/files/projects/swiftui/how-to-control-spacing-around-individual-views-using-padding-2.zip)

The text “Using” and “SwiftUI” placed some distance above the text “rocks”.

Or you might want to control how much padding is applied to all sides:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Using")
    Text("SwiftUI")
        .padding(100)
    Text("rocks")
}
```

> [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-zipper"/>Download this as an Xcode project](https://hackingwithswift.com/files/projects/swiftui/how-to-control-spacing-around-individual-views-using-padding-3.zip)

The text “SwiftUI” surrounded by lots of whitespace, with the text “Using” above and “rocks” below.

Or you can combine the two to add a specific amount of padding to one side of the view:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Using")
    Text("SwiftUI")
        .padding(.bottom, 100)
    Text("rocks")
}
```

> [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-zipper"/>Download this as an Xcode project](https://hackingwithswift.com/files/projects/swiftui/how-to-control-spacing-around-individual-views-using-padding-4.zip)

The text “Using” and “SwiftUI” placed a long distance above the text “rocks”.
