**New in iOS 16**

SwiftUI's `Grid` view lets us create a static grid of views, with precise control over what goes into each row and column. You mark out individual rows using `GridRow`, then optionally also configure how wide each cell should be.

As a basic example, this creates a 2x2 grid with text reflecting where each cell with be positioned:

```swift
Grid {
    GridRow {
        Text("Top Leading")
            .background(.red)

        Text("Top Trailing")
            .background(.orange)
    }

    GridRow {
        Text("Bottom Leading")
            .background(.green)

        Text("Bottom Trailing")
            .background(.blue)
    }
}
.font(.title)
```

If you don't want to have the same number of cells in each row, you have three choices.

First, if you do nothing, SwiftUI will automatically insert empty cells to make sure the rows are equal. So, in this code we can add to the red and blue scores freely, and SwiftUI will keep the whole thing balanced:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var redScore = 0
    @State private var blueScore = 0

    var body: some View {
        Grid {
            GridRow {
                Text("Red")

                ForEach(0..<redScore, id: \.self) { _ in
                    Rectangle()
                        .fill(.red)
                        .frame(width: 20, height: 20)
                }
            }

            GridRow {
                Text("Blue")

                ForEach(0..<blueScore, id: \.self) { _ in
                    Rectangle()
                        .fill(.blue)
                        .frame(width: 20, height: 20)
                }
            }
        }
        .font(.title)

        Button("Add to Red") { redScore += 1 }
        Button("Add to Blue") { blueScore += 1 }
    }
}
```

The second option is to place views into the grid without wrapping them in a `GridRow`, which will cause them to occupy a whole row by themselves. This is great for the `Divider` view. The third option is to use the `gridCellColumns()` modifier, to make one cell span multiple columns.

We can see the second and third option in a single code sample:

```swift
Grid {
    GridRow {
        Text("Food")
        Text("$200")
    }

    GridRow {
        Text("Rent")
        Text("$800")
    }

    GridRow {
        Text("Candles")
        Text("$3600")
    }

    Divider()

    GridRow {
        Text("$4600")
            .gridCellColumns(2)
            .multilineTextAlignment(.trailing)
    }

}
.font(.title)
```

As you can see, using `gridCellColumns()` with the same number of columns you have yields the same result as placing a view outside of a `GridRow`.

Important: Unlike `LazyHGrid` and `LazyVGrid`, a plain `Grid` loads all its views immediately, so be careful how much work you do.

Grids are fantastic choices when you need exact layouts - we can use them to make a tic-tac-toe board:

```swift
Grid(horizontalSpacing: 20, verticalSpacing: 20) {
    GridRow {
        Image(systemName: "xmark")
        Image(systemName: "xmark")
        Image(systemName: "xmark")
    }

    GridRow {
        Image(systemName: "circle")
        Image(systemName: "xmark")
        Image(systemName: "circle")
    }

    GridRow {
        Image(systemName: "xmark")
        Image(systemName: "circle")
        Image(systemName: "circle")
    }
}
.font(.largeTitle)
```

Or even a chessboard:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Grid(horizontalSpacing: 0, verticalSpacing: 0) {
            ForEach(0..<8) { row in
                GridRow {
                    ForEach(0..<8) { col in
                        if (row + col).isMultiple(of: 2) {
                            Rectangle()
                                .fill(.black)
                        } else {
                            Rectangle()
                                .fill(.white)
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        .aspectRatio(1, contentMode: .fit)
        .border(.black, width: 1)
        .padding()
    }
}
```
