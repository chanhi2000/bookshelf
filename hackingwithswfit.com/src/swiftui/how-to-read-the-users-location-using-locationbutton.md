**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI has a dedicated `LocationButton` view for displaying a standard UI for requesting user location. Sadly, it doesn’t do any of the work of getting the location for us, but it at least has a recognizable user interface that we can work with.

In order to use this, you first need to import two frameworks, one for reading the location and one for showing the button:

```swift
import CoreLocation
import CoreLocationUI
```

Next, you create some kind of `ObservableObject` that is able to request the user’s location on demand. This needs to create a `CLLocationManager` and call its `requestLocation()` method on demand. You can then put **that** inside a SwiftUI view showing a location button.

So, you might write something like this:

```swift
class LocationManager: NSObject, ObservableObject, CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    let manager = CLLocationManager()

    @Published var location: CLLocationCoordinate2D?

    override init() {
        super.init()
        manager.delegate = self
    }

    func requestLocation() {
        manager.requestLocation()
    }

    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        location = locations.first?.coordinate
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var locationManager = LocationManager()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if let location = locationManager.location {
                Text("Your location: \(location.latitude), \(location.longitude)")
            }

            LocationButton {
                locationManager.requestLocation()
            }
            .frame(height: 44)
            .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

Apple provides a handful of variant designs for the button, activated by passing one of them in with its initializer - try `LocationButton(.shareMyCurrentLocation)`, for example.
