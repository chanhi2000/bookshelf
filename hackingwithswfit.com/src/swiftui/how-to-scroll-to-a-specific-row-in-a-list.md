> Updated for Xcode 15

If you want to programmatically make SwiftUI's `List` move to show a specific row, you should embed it inside a `ScrollViewReader`. This provides a `scrollTo()` method on its proxy that can move to any row inside the list, just by providing its ID and optionally also an anchor.

For example, this creates 100 rows in a list, and when you press the button it will scroll directly to the row with ID 50:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollViewReader { proxy in
            VStack {
                Button("Jump to #50") {
                    proxy.scrollTo(50)
                }

                List(0..<100, id: \.self) { i in
                    Text("Example \(i)")
                    .id(i)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

For more control over your scroll behavior, add an `anchor` as the second parameter, like this: `proxy.scrollTo(50, anchor: .top)`.

::: tip

If you call `scrollTo()` inside `withAnimation()` the movement will be animated.
