> Updated for Xcode 15

Most of Apple’s operating systems support both light and dark mode user interfaces, so it’s no surprise that SwiftUI has support for this functionality built right in.

Even better, once you’ve designed your interface Xcode allows you to preview your layouts in either appearance by setting the `‌preferredColorScheme()` modifier value in your preview.

For example, this shows a preview using dark mode:

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView().preferredColorScheme(.dark)
    }
}
```

If you want to see both light and dark mode side by side, place multiple previews in a group, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ForEach(ColorScheme.allCases, id: \.self) { 
             ContentView().preferredColorScheme($0)
        }
    }
}
```

For a little extra conciseness, you can boil that down even further: 

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ForEach(ColorScheme.allCases, id: \.self, content: ContentView().preferredColorScheme)
    }
}
```

::: tip

If your preview is zoomed right in, you should either scroll around or zoom out to the other previews.
