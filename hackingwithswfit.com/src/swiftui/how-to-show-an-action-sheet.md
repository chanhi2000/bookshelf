> Updated for Xcode 15

**Updated in iOS 15**

SwiftUI allows us to show a selection of options to the user with using its `confirmationDialog()` modifier, but if you’re targeting iOS 14 or earlier you need to use `ActionSheet` instead. I’ll show you both here, but if you’re targeting iOS 15 or later, or if you want to support macOS, you should use `confirmationDialog()`.

To create your action sheet using `confirmationDialog()`, provide some title text, a binding to determine when the sheet should be shown, and optionally also whether you want the title text to appear - if you don’t specify this, SwiftUI will decide for you based on context.

So, this shows a sheet asking the user to select a paint color from three options:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingOptions = false
    @State private var selection = "None"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(selection)

            Button("Confirm paint color") {
                showingOptions = true
            }
            .confirmationDialog("Select a color", isPresented: $showingOptions, titleVisibility: .visible) {
                Button("Red") {
                    selection = "Red"
                }

                Button("Green") {
                    selection = "Green"
                }

                Button("Blue") {
                    selection = "Blue"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

::: tip

This API uses a standard SwiftUI `Button` for each action, so you can attach a role such as `.destructive` to have SwiftUI color it appropriately.

:::

![A menu titled “Select a color” and options Red, Green, and Blue. The Red option is red colored.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-show-an-action-sheet-2~dark@2x.png)

Because this new API is more flexible, we can actually collapse down those actions into a simple loop using `ForEach`:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingOptions = false
    @State private var selection = "None"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(selection)

            Button("Confirm paint color") {
                showingOptions = true
            }
            .confirmationDialog("Select a color", isPresented: $showingOptions, titleVisibility: .visible) {
                ForEach(["Red", "Green", "Blue"], id: \.self) { color in
                    Button(color) {
                        selection = color
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you need to target iOS 14 or below you should use the older `ActionSheet` approach to achieve the same result. This also works by defining a property to track whether the action sheet should be visible or not.

For example, here is an example view that triggers an action sheet when a button is tapped:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingOptions = false
    @State private var selection = "None"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(selection)

            Button("Show Options") {
                showingOptions = true
            }
            .actionSheet(isPresented: $showingOptions) {
                ActionSheet(
                    title: Text("Select a color"),
                    buttons: [
                        .default(Text("Red")) {
                            selection = "Red"
                        },

                        .default(Text("Green")) {
                            selection = "Green"
                        },

                        .default(Text("Blue")) {
                            selection = "Blue"
                        },
                    ]
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```
