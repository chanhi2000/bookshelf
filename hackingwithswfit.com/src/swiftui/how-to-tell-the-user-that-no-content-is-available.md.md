> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI has a dedicated `ContentUnavailableView` type designed to show users when nothing is available to see. For example, if they perform a search that yields no results, using `ContentUnavailableView` is much nicer than showing a blank screen.

In its simplest form, you just need to use this code to show a failed search results screen:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ContentUnavailableView.search
    }
}
```

![The default ContentUnavailableView, showing No Results and a prompt for the user to try again.](https://hackingwithswift.com//img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-tell-the-user-that-no-content-is-available-1~dark@2x.png)

You’ll see a magnifying glass icon, backed up by title and subtitle text explaining that the user’s search yielded no results.

You can customize it if you want, to add what the user was searching for:

```swift
ContentUnavailableView.search(text: "Life, the Universe, and Everything")
```

But you can also customize the icon and description too, giving a completely bespoke result:

```swift
ContentUnavailableView("No favorites", systemImage: "star", description: Text("You don't have any favorites yet."))
    .symbolVariant(.slash)
```

![A customize ContentUnavailableView, showing No Favorites and a message telling the user they have no favorites.](https://hackingwithswift.com//img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-tell-the-user-that-no-content-is-available-3~dark@2x.png)
