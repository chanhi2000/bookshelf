**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI's `swipeActions()` modifier lets you add one or more swipe action buttons to your list rows, optionally controlling which side they belong to, and also whether they should be triggered using a full swipe.

For example, this creates a list with two static items and attaches a different swipe action to each of them:

```swift
List {
    Text("Pepperoni pizza")
        .swipeActions {
            Button("Order") {
                print("Awesome!")
            }
            .tint(.green)
        }

    Text("Pepperoni with pineapple")
        .swipeActions {
            Button("Burn") {
                print("Right on!")
            }
            .tint(.red)
        }
}
```

Notice how the buttons are tinted to make them stand out - without that each button will just appear gray.

::: tip

For genuinely destructive buttons, you should use `Button(role: .destructive)` rather than just assigning a red tint color.

:::

By default, the first of your swipe actions will be automatically triggered if the user swipes far enough. If you want to disable this, set `allowsFullSwipe` to false when creating your swipe actions.

To demonstrate this, here's a list that adds two swipe actions per friend shown in the list, but neither of them are triggered by default no matter how far the user swipes:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let friends = ["Antoine", "Bas", "Curt", "Dave", "Erica"]

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(friends, id: \.self) { friend in
                    Text(friend)
                        .swipeActions(allowsFullSwipe: false) {
                            Button {
                                print("Muting conversation")
                            } label: {
                                Label("Mute", systemImage: "bell.slash.fill")
                            }
                            .tint(.indigo)

                            Button(role: .destructive) {
                                print("Deleting conversation")
                            } label: {
                                Label("Delete", systemImage: "trash.fill")
                            }
                        }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI is smart enough to adapt our label to show only the icon when used as a swipe action, but our text label still gets read out by VoiceOver.

If you want to add different swipe actions to either side of a row, just call `swipeActions()` twice with different edges. For example, we could make a swipe action calculator by adding or subtracting numbers depending on which side was swiped:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var total = 0

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            List {
                ForEach(1..<100) { i in
                    Text("\(i)")
                        .swipeActions(edge: .leading) {
                            Button {
                                total += i
                            } label: {
                                Label("Add \(i)", systemImage: "plus.circle")
                            }
                            .tint(.indigo)
                        }
                        .swipeActions(edge: .trailing) {
                            Button {
                                total -= i
                            } label: {
                                Label("Subtract \(i)", systemImage: "minus.circle")
                            }
                        }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Total: \(total)")
        }
    }
}
```
