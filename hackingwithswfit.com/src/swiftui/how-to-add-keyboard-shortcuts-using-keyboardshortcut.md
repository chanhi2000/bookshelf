> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI makes it easy to add keyboard shortcuts for devices that support it, such as iPadOS and macOS, all using the `keyboardShortcut()` modifier.

There are three ways you'll want to use this modifier, so let's start with the most basic: attaching a key to an existing action. For example, if we had a log in button and wanted to trigger its behavior when the user pressed <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> we could do this:

```swift
Button("Log in") {
    print("Authenticating…")
}
.keyboardShortcut("l")
```

Note that we don't need to specify that we mean <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>, because SwiftUI assumes the Command key is used unless we specify otherwise. If you run that code sample on an iPad, you'll see that holding down the <kbd>Cmd</kbd> key brings up the keyboard shortcuts overlay, showing <kbd>“Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> Login” already - SwiftUI automatically figured out what our button did and made it available.

The second way to use `keyboardShortcut()` is to specify which modifier keys you actually want. As an example, this creates two more buttons, one using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to trigger a Run button, and another for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to trigger a Home button:

```swift
VStack {
    Button("Run") {
        print("Running…")
    }
    .keyboardShortcut("r", modifiers: .shift)

    Button("Home") {
        print("Going home")
    }
    .keyboardShortcut("h", modifiers: [.control, .option, .command])
}
```

![The words “Run” and “Home” in blue, indicating they are tappable. Below that is iPadOS's command palette showing that “Run” has the shortcut <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, and “Home” has shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Opt</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-add-keyboard-shortcuts-using-keyboardshortcut-2~dark.png)

That shows you how to select one custom modifier, and how to select several modifiers at the same time.

The third and final way to use `keyboardShortcut()` is with one of its built-in keys, which are useful for hard to type keys such as Escape and arrows, and also for *semantic* keys, such as a cancellation action and a default action. Semantic keys are *really* useful - every time you've pressed Return to accept the default action of an alert, or pressed Escape to cancel an action, you've used semantic keys.

So, this creates a button with a default action shortcut, meaning that pressing Return will trigger it:

```swift
Button("Confirm Launch") {
    print("Launching drone…")
}
.keyboardShortcut(.defaultAction)
```
