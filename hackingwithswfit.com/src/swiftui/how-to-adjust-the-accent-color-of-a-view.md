> Updated for Xcode 15

iOS uses tint colors to give apps a coordinated theme, and the same functionality is available in SwiftUI under the name *accent colors*. Just like in UIKit, when you set the accent color of one view it affects all those inside it, so if you set the access color of your top-level control then everything gets colored.

For example, this creates a button inside a `VStack`, then gives it an orange accent color:

```swift
VStack {
    Button("Press Here") {
        print("Button pressed!")
    }
}
.accentColor(.orange)
```
