> Updated for Xcode 15

Most text can be read as words, but some special text such as passwords, stock symbols, and certain numbers, must be read by VoiceOver letter by letter in order to be useful. In SwiftUI this can be enabled using the `speechSpellsOutCharacters()` modifier, which is used like this:

```swift
Text("abCayer-muQai")
    .speechSpellsOutCharacters()
```

This modifier returns another `Text` instance, which means you can chain it to other `Text`-only modifiers if you want.

It works particular well when grouping accessibility elements together so they are read as one, like this:

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Your password is")
    Text("abCayer-muQai")
        .font(.title)
        .speechSpellsOutCharacters()
}
.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)
```

Using that code, VoiceOver will automatically read “Your password is” naturally, then spell out the password part as requested.
