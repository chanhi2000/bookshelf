> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI has a dedicated `buttonRepeatBehavior()` modifier that trigger's a button's action repeatedly when the user holds it down. The action is triggered increasingly quickly, so it fires faster the longer the user holds it down.

For example, this adds 1 to a counter when pressed, but if you hold the button down it continues to add 1 increasingly quickly:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var tapCount = 0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(tapCount)") {
            tapCount += 1
        }
        .buttonRepeatBehavior(.enabled)
    }
}
```

This repeating behavior also works with keyboard shortcuts, although there its limited by whatever keyboard repeat rate your user has.

For example, this allows the user to hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> to trigger our button repeatedly:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var tapCount = 0

    var body: some View {
        Button("Tap Count: \(tapCount)") {
            tapCount += 1
        }
        .buttonRepeatBehavior(.enabled)
        .keyboardShortcut(.return, modifiers: .shift)
    }
}
```
