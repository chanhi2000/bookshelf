> Updated for Xcode 15

Navigation sits at the heart of so many apps, and SwiftUI does a great job of making it easy out of the box. This means we get a simple and natural approach using `NavigationLink`, full control over programmatic navigation using `Navigationpath`, support for two- and three-view layout with `NavigationSplitView`, and more.

This means a lot of the time you can forget about the easier stuff and focus on the parts that need more thought, such as:

- Making customizable toolbars with sensible defaults
- Saving and loading your user's navigation with state restoration
- Deciding when and how to show a sidebar, or adding an extra content view if needed.
- Combining `NavigationSplitView` *and* `NavigationStack` to get exactly the structure you want.

These aren't necessarily hard, they just take more planning to get right.
