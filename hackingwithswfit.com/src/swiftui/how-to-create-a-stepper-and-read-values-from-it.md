SwiftUI's `Stepper` control lets users select values from a range we specify, providing the same functionality as `UIStepper` from UIKit.

As an example, this creates a stepper bound to an `age` property, letting users select values in the range 0 through 130 inclusive:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var age = 18

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Stepper("Enter your age", value: $age, in: 0...130)
            Text("Your age is \(age)")
        }
    }
}
```

Rather than binding directly to a value, you can also provide custom `onIncrement` and `onDecrement` closures to do custom work, like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var age = 18

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Stepper("Enter your age", onIncrement: {
                age += 1
            }, onDecrement: {
                age -= 1
            })

            Text("Your age is \(age)")
        }
    }
}
```
