**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI's `visualEffect()` modifier lets us read the geometry proxy for a view *without* using a `GeometryReader`, which means we can look at the size and location of a view without affecting its layout behavior.

::: important

This modifier is specifically for applying visual effects such as adjusting colors or adding blur, and cannot adjust how the frame of your content is calculated for layout purposes. It *can* adjust frame-*like* things such as the offset and scale of your view, because they don't affect layout.

:::

As an example, the following code blurs each view in a scroll view by some blur amount that's calculated by how far away the view is away from the center of its scroll view. That means views near the vertical center have little or no blur, whereas views on the outside are heavily blurred:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            ForEach(0..<100) { i in
                Text("Row \(i)")
                    .font(.largeTitle)
                    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                    .visualEffect { content, proxy in
                        content.blur(radius: blurAmount(for: proxy))
                    }
            }
        }
    }

    func blurAmount(for proxy: GeometryProxy) -> Double {
        let scrollViewHeight = proxy.bounds(of: .scrollView)?.height ?? 100
        let ourCenter = proxy.frame(in: .scrollView).midY
        let distanceFromCenter = abs(scrollViewHeight / 2 - ourCenter)
        return Double(distanceFromCenter) / 100
    }
}
```

::: tip

Calling `proxy.frame(in: .scrollView)` finds the size of this view in the innermost scroll view that contains it.

:::

These visual effects work with any kind of position, including that generated through animation. For example, this makes a series of circles in a grid spin around, with each one dynamically recoloring based on a hue rotation:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var rotationAmount = 0.0

    var body: some View {
        Grid {
            ForEach(0..<3) { _ in
                GridRow {
                    ForEach(0..<3) { _ in
                        Circle()
                            .fill(.green)
                            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
                            .visualEffect { content, proxy in
                                content.hueRotation(.degrees(proxy.frame(in: .global).midY / 2))
                            }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        .rotationEffect(.degrees(rotationAmount))
        .onAppear {
            withAnimation(.linear(duration: 5).repeatForever(autoreverses: false)) {
                rotationAmount = 360
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The modifier's name, `visualEffect()`, should make it clear that any adjustments you make are limited how the finished view looks - if you find yourself wanting to use it to adjust view *content*, you're looking in the wrong place.
