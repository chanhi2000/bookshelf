Every SwiftUI makes the same mistake at some point, and sadly it’s something you’ll do more than once: rather than writing `.someModifier()` you write `someModifier()`, and it causes your app to completely freeze or crash with `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`.

First I’ll show you the how to solve the problem, then I’ll explain what the underlying problem is. The solution is to use Swift’s `@warn_unqualified_access` attribute, which means you can’t access properties or methods without using a variable name or similar.

For example, if we had a `titleStyle()` method that added a bunch of modifiers to a view to make it matching a custom theme, we’d use `@warn_unqualified_access` before the method signature, like this:

```swift
extension View {
    @warn_unqualified_access
    func titleStyle() -> some View {
        self
            .font(.largeTitle)
            .fontWeight(.black)
            .padding()
            .background(.blue)
            .foregroundStyle(.white)
            .cornerRadius(10)
    }
}
```

When we use that, we’d write the same SwiftUI code we always did:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome")
            .titleStyle()
    }
}
```

That works exactly as expected - the extra attribute hasn’t made the method behave differently at all in normal circumstances.

However, take a look at *this* code:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Welcome")
            titleStyle()
    }
}
```

That’s subtly different: I removed the dot before `titleStyle()`, which is an *unqualified access* - I haven’t said where I’m calling `titleStyle()`, so SwiftUI assumes I’m actually calling it on `ContentView`. This means it’s actually calling `self.padding()`, so we have an infinitely recursive view and ultimately a crash.

Sadly, SwiftUI doesn’t use `@warn_unqualified_access` with its own modifiers, but you can at least add it for the custom ones you build.
