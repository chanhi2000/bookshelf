> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI has a dedicated property wrapper for reading values from `UserDefaults`, which will automatically reinvoke your view’s body property when the value changes. That is, this wrapper effectively watches a key in `UserDefaults`, and will refresh your UI if that key changes.

For example, this will watch `UserDefaults` for a “username” key, which will be set when the button is pressed:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @AppStorage("username") var username: String = "Anonymous"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Welcome, \(username)!")

            Button("Log in") {
                username = "@twostraws"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Changing `username` above will cause the new string to be written to `UserDefaults` immediately, while also updating the view. The same would be true if we had used the older method:

```swift
UserDefaults.standard.set("@twostraws", forKey: "username")
```

`@AppStorage` will watch `UserDefaults.standard` by default, but you can also make it watch a particular app group if you prefer, like this:

```swift
@AppStorage("username", store: UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.hackingwithswift.unwrap")) var username: String = "Anonymous"
```

::: important

`@AppStorage` writes your data to `UserDefaults`, which is *not* secure storage. As a result, you should not save any personal data using `@AppStorage`, because it’s relatively easy to extract.
