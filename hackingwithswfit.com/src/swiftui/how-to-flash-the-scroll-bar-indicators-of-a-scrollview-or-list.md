> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 17**

SwiftUI gives us the `scrollIndicatorsFlash()` modifier to control when the scroll indicators for a `ScrollView` or `List` should flash, which is a great way to notify your users that some part of its data has changed. This modifier comes in two forms: whether the indicators should flash when the scroll view appears, or whether they should flash when a value changes.

For example, to make a scroll view's indicators flash when it's first shown, use this:

```swift
ScrollView {
    ForEach(0..<50) { i in
        Text("Item \(i)")
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
    }
}
.scrollIndicatorsFlash(onAppear: true)
```

Alternatively, you can provide a custom value that tracks whether the indicators should be flashed. This can be any `Equatable` value, and whenever that value changes SwiftUI will flash the indicators.

So you could increment an integer, generate a random `UUID`, or simply flip a Boolean between true and false like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var exampleState = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ScrollView {
                ForEach(0..<50) { i in
                    Text("Item \(i)")
                        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
                        .background(.blue)
                        .foregroundStyle(.white)
                }
            }
            .scrollIndicatorsFlash(trigger: exampleState)

            Button("Flash!") {
                exampleState.toggle()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

![A scrollview containing many items. The scrollview flashes whenever a button is pressed.](https://hackingwithswift.com/img/books/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-flash-the-scroll-bar-indicators-of-a-scrollview-or-list-1~dark.gif)

This same code works with `List` in just the same way it works with `ScrollView`.
