> Updated for Xcode 15

SwiftUI doesn't have a dedicated modifier for displaying background colors or images, but instead lets us specify any kind of background view using its `background()` modifier.

For example, this creates a text view with a large font, then places a 100x100 image behind it:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .font(.system(size: 48))
    .padding(50)
    .background(
        Image("singapore")
            .resizable()
    )
```

However, it doesn't _need_ to be an image. For example, this creates the same text view then places a 50x50 red circle behind it:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .padding()
    .background(Circle()
        .fill(.red)
        .frame(width: 50, height: 50))
```

By default background views automatically take up as much space as they need to be fully visible, but if you want you can have them be clipped to the size of their parent view using the `clipped()` modifier:

```swift
Text("Hacking with Swift")
    .font(.largeTitle)
    .padding()
    .background(
        Circle()
            .fill(.red)
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
    )
    .clipped()
```

To be clear, you can use _any_ view as your background - another text view if you wanted, for example.
