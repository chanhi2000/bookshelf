SwiftUI's `@StateObject` property wrapper is a specialized form of `@ObservedObject`, having all the same functionality with one important addition: it should be used to *create* observed objects, rather than just store one that was passed in externally. 

When you add a property to a view using `@StateObject`, SwiftUI considers that view to be the owner of the observable object. All other views where you pass that object should use `@ObservedObject`.

**This really matters.** Seriously, if you get this wrong you might find your object gets destroyed by accident, which will cause your app to crash seemingly randomly.

So, to be clear: you should create your observable object somewhere using `@StateObject`, and in all subsequent places where you pass that object you should use `@ObservedObject`.

Here's an example in code:

```swift
// An example class to work with
class Player: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name = "Taylor"
    @Published var age = 26
}

// A view that creates and owns the Player object.
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var player = Player()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            NavigationLink {
                PlayerNameView(player: player)
            } label: {
                Text("Show detail view")
            }
        }
    }
}

// A view that monitors the Player object for changes, but
// doesn't own it.
struct PlayerNameView: View {
    @ObservedObject var player: Player

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, \(player.name)!")
    }
}
```

If you're finding it hard to remember the distinction, try this: whenever you see “State” in a property wrapper, e.g. `@State`, `@StateObject`, `@GestureState`, it means “the current view owns this data.”
