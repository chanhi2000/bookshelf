**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI provides the `interactiveDismissDisabled()` modifier to control whether the user can swipe downwards to dismiss a sheet. Although swipe to dismiss is usually nice to have, sometimes that’s something you can’t allow - if the user must accept some terms and conditions, for example, then they must take some sort of action before the sheet can be dismissed.

In its simplest form, you just need to attach the `interactiveDismissDisabled()` modifier directly to your sheet content, like this:

```swift
struct ExampleSheet: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Sheet view")

            Button("Dismiss", action: close)
        }
        .interactiveDismissDisabled()
    }

    func  close() {
        dismiss()
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingSheet = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Sheet") {
            showingSheet.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingSheet, content: ExampleSheet.init)
    }
}
```

If you prefer, you can bind a Boolean to the modifier to allow swipe to dismiss only when some criteria is successfully met. So, our terms and conditions example might look like this:

```swift
struct ExampleSheet: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
    @State private var termsAccepted = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Terms and conditions")
                .font(.title)
            Text("Lots of legalese here.")
            Toggle("Accept", isOn: $termsAccepted)
        }
        .padding()
        .interactiveDismissDisabled(!termsAccepted)
    }

    func  close() {
        dismiss()
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingSheet = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Sheet") {
            showingSheet.toggle()
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingSheet, content: ExampleSheet.init)
    }
}
```
