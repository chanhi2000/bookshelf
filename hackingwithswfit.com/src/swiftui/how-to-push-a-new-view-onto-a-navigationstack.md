SwiftUI lets us push any view onto a `NavigationStack` by using `NavigationLink`. In its simplest form you can provide this with a string for its title and a destination view as a trailing closure, and `NavigationStack` will care of pushing the new view on the stack for us along with animation.

For example, this creates a simple `DetailView` struct, then presents it from a `NavigationStack`:

```swift
struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is the detail view")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack {
                NavigationLink("Show Detail View") {
                    DetailView()
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Navigation")
        }
    }
}
```

If you need more advanced control over the label, pass it as a secondary trailing closure. For example, this uses a `Label` view rather than a simple string:

```swift
struct DetailView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is the detail view")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            VStack {
                NavigationLink {
                    DetailView()
                } label: {
                    Label("Show Detail View", systemImage: "globe")
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Navigation")
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI will automatically style your links as buttons so users know they are interactive. You can disable this behavior by applying `.buttonStyle(.plain)` to `NavigationLink`.
