SwiftUI lets us draw custom paths by conforming to the `Shape` protocol, so we can create our own shapes that work the same as `Rectangle`, `Capsule`, and `Circle`. Conforming to this protocol isn’t hard, because all you need to do is support a `path(in:)` method that accepts a `CGRect` and returns a `Path`. Even better, you can use any paths you’ve previously built using `CGPath` or `UIBezierPath`, then convert the result to a SwiftUI path.

If you want to use SwiftUI’s native `Path` type, create a variable instance of it then add as many points or shapes as you need. Don’t think about colors, fills, or stroke widths - you’re focusing on the raw shape here, and those kinds of settings are provided when your custom path is used.

For example, we could make a creative effect by drawing a series of shrinking squares, then placing that shape into a SwiftUI view with a stroke and a size:

```swift
struct ShrinkingSquares: Shape {
    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        var path = Path()

        for i in stride(from: 1, through: 100, by: 5.0) {
            let rect = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: rect.width, height: rect.height)
            let insetRect = rect.insetBy(dx: i, dy: i)
            path.addRect(insetRect)
        }

        return path
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ShrinkingSquares()
            .stroke()
            .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
    }
}
```
