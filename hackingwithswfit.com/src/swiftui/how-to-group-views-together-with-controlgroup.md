> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI's `ControlGroup` View lets us tell the system that two or more views should be grouped together because they are related. What it *does* with that information is down to the context where they are used and the platform your code is running on.

For example, on iOS and macOS, this will display three buttons attached horizontally, in a style sometimes called “momentary segmented”:

```swift
ControlGroup {
    Button("First") { }
    Button("Second") { }
    Button("Third") { }
}
.padding()
```

> [<VPIcon icon="fas fa-file-zipper"/>Download this as an Xcode project](https://hackingwithswift.com/files/projects/swiftui/how-to-group-views-together-with-controlgroup-1.zip)

When you run that code you'll see the buttons are clearly attached to each other visually, but still operate individually.

`ControlGroup` is particularly useful when creating customizable toolbars, where buttons in a control group must be added or removed together rather than split up.
