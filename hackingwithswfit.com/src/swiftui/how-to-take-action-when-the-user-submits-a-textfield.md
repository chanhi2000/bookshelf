> Updated for Xcode 15

**New in iOS 15**

SwiftUI has an `onSubmit()` modifier that can be attached to any view in your hierarchy, and will run a function of your choice when the user has finished entering text into a `TextField` or `SecureField`.

For example, we could ask the user to enter their password, then run some code when they press return:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var password = ""

    var body: some View {
        SecureField("Password", text: $password)
            .onSubmit {
                print("Authenticating…")
            }
    }
}
```

For simple examples like that, both `TextField` and `SecureField` accept a dedicated `onCommit` parameter where we can attach our function directly to them. However, the advantage to using `onSubmit()` is that it captures all text values submitted in its context, which makes completing forms easier:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var username = ""
    @State private var password = ""

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
            SecureField("Password", text: $password)
        }
        .onSubmit {
            guard username.isEmpty == false && password.isEmpty == false else { return }
            print("Authenticating…")
        }
    }
}
```
