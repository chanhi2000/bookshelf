If you created a SwiftUI `Image` and it isn’t being resized, look for code like this:

```swift
Image("cornwall")
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
```

That explicitly sets the image’s frame, but *doesn’t* mark the image as being resizable. The correct thing to do is add the `resizable()` modifier before the frame, like this:

```swift
Image("cornwall")
    .resizable()
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
```
