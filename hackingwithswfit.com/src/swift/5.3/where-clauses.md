> Available from Swift 5.3

[SE-0267 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0267-where-on-contextually-generic.md) introduced the ability to attach a `where` clause to functions inside generic types and extensions.

For example, we could start with a simple `Stack` struct that let us push and pop values from a private array:

```swift
struct Stack<Element> {
    private var array = [Element]()

    mutating func push(_ obj: Element) {
        array.append(obj)
    }

    mutating func pop() -> Element? {
        array.popLast()
    }
}
```

Using SE-0267, we could add a new `sorted()` method to that stack, but only for times when the elements inside the stack conform to `Comparable`:

```swift
extension Stack {
    func sorted() -> [Element] where Element: Comparable {
        array.sorted()
    }
}
```
