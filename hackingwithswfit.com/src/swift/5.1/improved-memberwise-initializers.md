> Available from Swift 5.1

[SE-0242 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0242-default-values-memberwise.md) introduced major improvements to one of Swift’s most commonly used features: memberwise initializers for structs.

In earlier versions of Swift, a memberwise initializer was automatically created to accept parameters matching the properties of a struct, like this:

```swift
struct User {
    var name: String
    var loginCount: Int = 0
}

let piper = User(name: "Piper Chapman", loginCount: 0)
```

In Swift 5.1 this has been enhanced so that the memberwise initializer now uses default parameter values for any properties that have them. In the `User` struct we’ve given `loginCount` a default value of 0, which means we can either specify it or leave it to the memberwise initializer:

```swift
let gloria = User(name: "Gloria Mendoza", loginCount: 0)
let suzanne = User(name: "Suzanne Warren")
```

This lets us avoid repeating code, which is always welcome.
