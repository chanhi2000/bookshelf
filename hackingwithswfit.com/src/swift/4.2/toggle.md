> Available from Swift 4.2

[SE-0199 (<VPIcon icon="iconfont icon-github"/>`apple/swift-evolution`)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0199-bool-toggle.md) introduced a new `toggle()` method to booleans that flip them between true and false..

The entire code to implement proposal is only a handful of lines of Swift:

```swift
extension Bool {
   mutating func toggle() {
      self = !self
   }
}
```

However, the end result makes for much more natural Swift code:

```swift
var loggedIn = false
loggedIn.toggle()
```

As noted in the proposal, this is particularly useful in more complex data structures: `myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled.toggle()` avoids the potential typing errors that could be caused using manual negation.

The proposal makes Swift easier and safer to write, and is purely additive, so I think most folks will switch to using it quickly enough.
