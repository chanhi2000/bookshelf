{
  "title": "How to create keyframe animations using CAKeyframeAnimation",
  "desc": "Keyframe animations offer extraordinary power for developers because they let you set multiple values and have iOS animate between them over times you specify. There are three components: a key path (the property to animate), an array of values (the value you want to use for that property), and an array of key times (when that value should be used for the property)....",

  "title": "How to draw shapes using CAShapeLayer",
  "desc": "There are lots of <code>CALayer</code> subclasses out there, but <code>CAShapeLayer</code> is one of my favorites: it provides hardware-accelerated drawing of all sorts of 2D shapes, and includes extra functionality such as fill and stroke colors, line caps, patterns and more....",

  "desc": "Believe it or not, iOS has a built-in particle system that works great in all UIKit apps and is immensely customizable. To get started you need to create a <code>CAEmitterLayer</code> object and tell it how to create particles: where it should create them, how big the emitter should be, and what types of particles ",

  "desc": "iOS makes it easy to draw shapes using <code>CAShapeLayer</code>, but you also get the ability to adjust <em>how</em> shapes are drawn. By manipulating the <code>strokeStart</code> and <code>strokeEnd</code> properties you can make shapes draw themselves on the screen: you can present a half-drawn star, or a three-quarters drawn circle, for example....",

  "desc": "All <code>UIView</code> subclasses have a <code>layer</code> property, which is responsible for drawing their contents efficiently. These layers are powered by Core Animation, which handles all the drawing and animation that UIKit requests. The layer is separate from the view because drawing is separate from placement - you can move a <code>UIView</code> around freely, change its <code>alpha</code>, add or remove it all you want, and so on, but that doesn’t affect the underlying way it’s <em>drawn</em>....",
