<!-- 
Map views are pretty easy in iOS, largely because they are baked right into Interface Builder. That's right: open your storyboard, drag a map view into your view, and you're already most of the way there!

But there is one further thing to do, which is where people get confused: by default, the map framework won't actually be loaded when your app is run, which will make your app crash when it tries to show the map view.

The solution is simple: go to your project navigation, choose the Capabilities tab, then look for the "Maps" item and set it to be On. That's it!
