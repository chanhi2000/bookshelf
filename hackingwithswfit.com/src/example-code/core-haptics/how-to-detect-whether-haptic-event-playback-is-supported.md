<!-- 
Modern iPhones have extremely sensitive haptic engines inside, allowing us precise control over taps and vibrations, and even mixing effects - see “<a href="/example-code/core-haptics/how-to-play-custom-vibrations-using-core-haptics">How to play custom vibrations using Core Haptics</a>” and “<a href="/example-code/core-haptics/how-to-modify-haptic-events-over-time-using-chhapticparametercurve">How to modify haptic events over time using CHHapticParameterCurve</a>” for more information on that.

However, not all devices support Core Haptics, which is why you should always check for supported hardware before trying to spin up any haptic feedback. Once you added an import for `CoreHaptics`, you can detect haptic availability like this:

```swift
if CHHapticEngine.capabilitiesForHardware().supportsHaptics {
    // your haptics code here
}
```

For easier access you could also make the check a computed property, like this:

```swift
var hapticsAvailable: Bool {
    CHHapticEngine.capabilitiesForHardware().supportsHaptics
}
```
