<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
If you have a `CGAffineTransform` and want to know what its scale component is - regardless of whether it has been rotated or translated - use this code:

```swift
func scale(from transform: CGAffineTransform) -> Double {
    return sqrt(Double(transform.a * transform.a + transform.c * transform.c))
}
```

-->
