<!-- 
You can stop the iOS screen sleeping by using the `isIdleTimerDisabled` property of your application. When set to true, this means the screen will never dim or go to sleep while your app is running, so be careful - you don't want to waste your user's battery life!

Here's an example:

```swift
UIApplication.shared.isIdleTimerDisabled = true
```
