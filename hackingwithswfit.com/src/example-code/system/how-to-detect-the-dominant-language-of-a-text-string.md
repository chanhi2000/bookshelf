<!-- 
The `NSLinguisticTagger` class has dedicated code to help you identify the dominant language of a text string. Before I show you the code, there are three important provisos:

1. It detects the *dominant* language, which means if you provide it with text that contains more than one language it will return whichever one appears most often.
<li>If you give it text where no identification can be made, e.g. some numbers or an empty string, it will return nil.
<li>It is extraordinarily fast - you can feed it thousands of article-length strings a second and it will fly through them.

Here’s an example to help you get started:

```swift
let text = "Ceci n'est pas une pipe"

if let language = NSLinguisticTagger.dominantLanguage(for: text) {
    print(language)
} else {
    print("Unknown language")
}
```

When that code runs it will print “fr”, because the dominant language in the text is French.
