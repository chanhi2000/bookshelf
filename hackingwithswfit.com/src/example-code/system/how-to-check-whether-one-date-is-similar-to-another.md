<!-- 
Apple’s `Calendar` object gives us lots of useful methods for evaluating dates in various ways. One of the most useful is the method `isDate(_:equalTo:toGranularity:)`, which lets us compare two dates at a specific level of granularity: do these two dates occur in the same minute? The same hour? Or day, week, year? 

As an example, here are two dates for us to work with:

```swift
let first = Date.now
let second = Date.now.addingTimeInterval(10000)
```

We can now check whether those two occur within the same day, like this:

```swift
let sameDay = Calendar.current.isDate(first, equalTo: second, toGranularity: .day)
```

If all you want to do is check whether a date points to some time during today, you should use `isDateInToday()` instead:

```swift
let isToday = Calendar.current.isDateInToday(first)
```
