<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async { [unowned self] in
    self.yourCodeHere()
}
```

The `.userInitiated` quality of service setting is the highest priority after `userInteractive`. You can also use `utility` (lower priority) or `.background` (lowest priority.)

The second option looks like this:

```swift
performSelector(inBackground: #selector(yourCodeHere), with: nil)
```

You'll need to replace `yourCodeHere` with the name of an actual method. If you want to pass a parameter, make sure and use “yourCodeHere:" and provide a value for the `with` parameter.
