<!-- 
You can write any kind of object to disk as long as it supports the `NSCoding` protocol - which includes strings, arrays, dictionaries, `UIView`, `UIColor` and more right out of the box. To write to disk, use this:

```swift
let randomFilename = UUID().uuidString
let fullPath = getDocumentsDirectory().appendingPathComponent(randomFilename)

do {
    let data = try NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: somethingToSave, requiringSecureCoding: false)
    try data.write(to: fullPath)
} catch {
    print("Couldn't write file")
}
```

That call to `getDocumentsDirectory()` is a small helper function I frequently use to write files to disk:

```swift
func getDocumentsDirectory() -> URL {
    let paths = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
    return paths[0]
}
```

When you want to read your object back you need to use `unarchiveObject(withFile:)`, but be warned: the file might not exist or might not be unarchivable, so this method returns an optional value that you need to unwrap carefully.

For example, if you want to unarchive an array of strings, you would use this code:

```swift
do {
    if let loadedStrings = try NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveTopLevelObjectWithData(data) as? [String] {
        savedArray = loadedStrings
    }
} catch {
    print("Couldn't read file.")
}
```
