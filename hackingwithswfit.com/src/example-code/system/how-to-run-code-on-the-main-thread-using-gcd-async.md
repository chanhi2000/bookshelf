<!-- 
Swift offers you two ways to run code on the main thread: GCD and `performSelector(onMainThread:)`. The first option looks like this:

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async { [unowned self] in
    self.yourCodeHere()
}
```

The second option looks like this:

```swift
performSelector(onMainThread: #selector(yourCodeHere), with: nil, waitUntilDone: false)
```

The GCD option (the first one) has the advantage that you can write your code inline, whereas the second one requires a dedicated method you can call.
