<!-- 
Swift has a helpful `stride()`, which lets you move from one value to another using any increment - and even lets you specify whether the upper bound is exclusive or inclusive.

First, some examples. This first example counts from 0 to 10 in 2s:

```swift
for i in stride(from: 0, to: 10, by: 2) {
    print(i)
}
```

This second example counts from 0 up to to 0.5, exclusive:

```swift
for i in stride(from: 0, to: 0.5, by: 0.1) {
    print(i)
}
```

Both those examples use `stride(from:to:by:)`, which counts from the start point up to by excluding the `to` parameter. If you want to count up and *including* the `to` parameter, you should use `stride(from:through:by:)`, like this:

```swift
for i in stride(from: 0, through: 10, by: 2) {
    print(i)
}
```
