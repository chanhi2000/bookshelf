<!-- 
You can find the minimum of three numbers by using the `min()` function twice. This function takes either two integers or two floating-point numbers, but can't accept mixed types. Here's an example:

```swift
let first = 10
let second = 15
let third = 18

let smallest = min(min(first, second), third)
```
