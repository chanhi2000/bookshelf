<!-- 
Swift’s `ExpressibleByStringLiteral` protocol lets us create any type directly from a string - as long as Swift understands what type you mean, you can create whatever you want.

For example, if you regularly hard-code URLs and are tired of force unwrapping them when you know they are definitely correct, you can make `URL` conform to `ExpressibleByStringLiteral` so that URLs can be created directly from strings:

```swift
extension URL: ExpressibleByStringLiteral {
    public init(stringLiteral value: String) {
        self = URL(string: value)!
    }
}
```

With that extension in place you can now write code like this:

```swift
let url: URL = "https://www.hackingwithswift.com"
print(url.absoluteString)
```

Notice that I’ve clearly marked `url` as being of type `URL` so that Swift doesn’t think it’s a regular string.
