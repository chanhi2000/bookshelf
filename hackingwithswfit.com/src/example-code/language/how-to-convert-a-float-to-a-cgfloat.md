<!-- 
The `Float` and `CGFloat` data types sound so similar you might think they were identical, but they aren't: `CGFloat` is flexible in that its precision adapts to the type of device it's running on, whereas `Float` is always a fixed precision. Thus, you never lose precision converting from `Float` to `CGFloat`, whereas you might going the other way.

To convert, just use the `CGFloat` constructor, like this:

```swift
let myCGFloat = CGFloat(myFloat)
```
