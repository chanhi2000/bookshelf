This might sound obvious, but protocol extensions are extensions to protocols as opposed to concrete types. For example, the `BinaryInteger` protocol is adopted by all integer types: `Int`, `Int64`, `UInt8`, and so on. If you wanted to add a method to all of those at once, you’d use a protocol extension to modify `BinaryInteger`, like this:

```swift
extension BinaryInteger {
    func cubed() -> Self {
        return self * self * self
    }
}
```

That `cubed()` method will now existing on all integer types, so you can write code like this:

```swift
let i: Int = 5
let j: UInt8 = 7
print(i.cubed())
print(j.cubed())
```

Note: `Self` with a capital S refers to whatever type conforms to the protocol, e.g. `Int` or `UInt32`, whereas `self` with a lowercase S refers to whatever the current value of the type is, e.g. 5 or 99.
