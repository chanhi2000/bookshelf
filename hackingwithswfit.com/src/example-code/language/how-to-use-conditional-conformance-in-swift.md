Conditional conformances <a href="/articles/50/whats-new-in-swift-4-1">were introduced in Swift 4.1</a>, and <a href="/articles/77/whats-new-in-swift-4-2">refined in Swift 4.2</a> to allow you to query them at runtime. They allow types to conform to a protocol only when certain conditions are met - hence “conditional conformance”.

For example, if we had a `Purchaseable` protocol:

```swift
protocol Purchaseable {
    func buy()
}
```

And a simple type that conforms to that protocol:

```swift
struct Book: Purchaseable {
    func buy() {
        print("You bought a book")
    }
}
```

Then we could make `Array` conform to `Purchaseable` if all the elements inside the array were also `Purchasable`:

```swift
extension Array: Purchaseable where Element: Purchaseable {
    func buy() {
        for item in self {
            item.buy()
        }
    }
}
```

You can add conditional conformances to new types, and you can use any protocol you want - it doesn’t need to be one you define.

For example, you might a generic `Box` class that is able to wrap a value so it can be passed by reference:

```swift
final class Box<T> {
    var value: T

    init(value: T) {
        self.value = value
    }
}
```

We could use that box to store `User` structs, like this:

```swift
struct User: Equatable {
    var username: String
}

let user = User(username: "twostraws")
let box1 = Box(value: user)
let box2 = Box(value: user)
```

We’ve made the `User` struct `Equatable`, which means we can compare two instances of it to see if they are equal. What conditional conformance let us do is make `Box` equatable if its content is also equatable, like this:

```swift
extension Box: Equatable where T: Equatable {
    static func == (lhs: Box<T>, rhs: Box<T>) -> Bool {
        return lhs.value == rhs.value
    }
}
```

With that in place, we can now check two boxes for equality directly, like this:

```swift
box1 == box2
```

Conditional conformance was enhanced in Swift 4.2, giving the ability to query a conditional conformance at runtime. Although this compiled in Swift 4.1, it would crash at runtime - a result no one wanted. 

Well, that’s now fixed, so if you receive data of one type and want to check if it can be converted to a conditionally conformed protocol, it works great.

For example:

```swift
let items: Any = [Book(), Book(), Book()]

if let books = items as? Purchaseable {
    books.buy()
}
```
