<!-- 
Both the `static` and `class` keywords allow us to attach variables to a class rather than to instances of a class. For example, you might create a `Student` class with properties such as `name` and `age`, then create a static `numberOfStudents` property that is owned by the `Student` class itself rather than individual instances.

Where `static` and `class` differ is how they support inheritance: When you make a `static` property it becomes owned by the class and cannot be changed by subclasses, whereas when you use `class` it may be overridden if needed.

For example, here’s a `Person` class with one static property and one class property:

```swift
class Person {
    static var count: Int {
        return 250
    }

    class var averageAge: Double {
        return 30
    }
}
```

If we created a `Student` class by inheriting from `Person`, trying to override `count` (the static property) would fail to compile if uncommented, whereas trying to override `averageAge` (the class property) is OK:

```swift
class Student: Person {
    // THIS ISN'T ALLOWED
    // override static var count: Int {
    //    return 150
    // }

    // THIS IS ALLOWED
    override class var averageAge: Double {
        return 19.5
    }
}
```
