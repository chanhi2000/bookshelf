<!-- 
Lazy sequences are regular sequences where each item is computed on demand rather than up front. For example, consider this array of numbers:

```swift
let numbers = Array(1...100000)
```

That will hold 100,000 numbers. Now, if we wanted to double all those numbers, we’d write something like this:

```swift
let doubled = numbers.map { $0 * 2 }
```

That will cause Swift to double all 100,000 numbers, and sometimes that’s exactly what you want. However, if you know you intend to use only a handful of them, you can make the calculation lazy instead, like this:

```swift
let lazyDoubled = numbers.lazy.map { $0 * 2 }
```

Now that `map()` call won’t do any work up front - it just stores the original array (numbers 1 to 100,000) alongside the transformation closure (double each number). So, when you request item 5,000 it can calculate just that one for you and return it in a split second - a significant time saving.
