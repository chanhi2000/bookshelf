<!-- 
Throwing functions in Swift are the main way we have of signaling that an operation failed, but sometimes it can be annoying to define a whole new error enum just to report a simple failure.

With a small extension to `String` you can make the whole process easier:

```swift
extension String: LocalizedError {
    public var errorDescription: String? { return self }
}
```

With that change you can now throw strings as errors, and they work just like regular errors. For example, you can create a throwing function like this one:

```swift
func doDangerousThing() throws {
    throw "I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that."
}
```

Then attempt to run it and print any errors that are thrown, like this:

```swift
do {
    try doDangerousThing()
} catch {
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

This only really works for errors that have one case, because you can’t match specific string errors.
