Swift lets you print all types of data, but some data is more useful than others thanks to the `CustomDebugStringConvertible` protocol. If you write a type conforming to that protocol, you must include a `debugDescription` string property that describes how instances of this type should be represented while debugging.

To test this out, we’re going to create a `Player` struct that stores a player’s name. When we try to debug an instance of this struct - i.e., print it out, or hover over it in the debugger - we just want the player’s name to come back, for easier debugging.

Try adding this struct to a playground:

```swift
struct Player: CustomDebugStringConvertible {
    var name: String = "@twostraws"

    var debugDescription: String {
        return name
    }
}
```

You can now create instances of that struct and print them out to see the player name:

```swift
let player = Player()
print(player)
```
