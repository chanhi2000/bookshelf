<!-- 
The `Comparable` protocol allows use to use the `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators with conforming data types, which in turn means that Swift knows how to sort arrays of those types. Most of Swift’s built-in types support `Comparable` out of the box, but if you want your own type to conform to them then you need to implement `<` - from that Swift can provide default implementations of the other three operators.

The `<` function needs to accept two instances of your type, one of the left-hand side and one on the right, and return true if the left-hand object should be ordered before the right-hand object.

As an example, consider this simple `Person` struct:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
}
```

That has one property called `name`, and we’re going to make `Person` conform to the `Comparable` protocol based on that property. This means writing a static method called `<` that takes two instances of `Person` and internally compares the `name` properties of each of them:

```swift
struct Person: Comparable {
    var name: String

    static func <(lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name < rhs.name
    }
}
```

With that in place you can now use `<` to compare two instances of `Person` like this:

```swift
let taylor = Person(name: "Taylor Swift")
let justin = Person(name: "Justin Bieber")
print(taylor < justin)
```
