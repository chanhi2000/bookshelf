<!-- 
The `removeAll(where:)` method performs a high-performance, in-place filter for collections. You give it a closure condition to run, and it will strip out all objects that match your condition. 

For example, if you have a collection of names and want to remove people called “Terry”, you’d use this:

```swift
var pythons = ["John", "Michael", "Graham", "Terry", "Eric", "Terry"]
pythons.removeAll { $0 == "Terry" }
print(pythons)
```

Using `removeAll(where:)` is more readable than using a reversed `filter()` call because it specifies what you *don’t* want rather than what you *want*. It’s also more performant than `filter()` because it removes object in place, and so avoids extra copying.
