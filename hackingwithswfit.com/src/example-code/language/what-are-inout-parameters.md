<!-- 
When you pass value types as parameters into a function, they are constants and so can’t be modified. Sometimes it would be convenient to change this so you *can* modify the values, and that’s what `inout` does for us: it lets us modify parameters inside a function, and have those changes persist *outside* the function.

For example, we could write a function that accepts a number and doubles it:

```swift
func double(_ number: inout Int) {
    number *= 2
}
```

That doesn’t return a value - it modifies the value that was passed in directly.

When it comes to *calling* functions with `inout` parameters, Swift has two rules: we must pass in variables, and we also need to use `&` before the parameter name to acknowledge that it might be changed.

So, we would call `double()` like this:

```swift
var number = 5
double(&number)
print(number)
```

That will print 10.

`inout` parameters are more common than you might realize. For example, if you use `+=` to append one string to another, it uses `inout` to modify the string in place.
