<!-- 
Optional values are a central concept in Swift, although admittedly they can be a little hard to understand at first. Put simply, an optional value is one that may or may not exist, which means Swift won't let you use it by accident - you need to either check whether it has a value and unwrap it, or force unwrap. Of the two options the first is definitely preferable, because it's significantly safer.

To check whether an optional has a value then unwrap it all in one, you should use `if let` syntax, like this:

```swift
// fetch an example optional string
let optionalString = fetchOptionalString()

// now unwrap it
if let unwrapped = optionalString {
    print(unwrapped)
}
```

In that example, the `print(unwrapped)` line will only be executed if `optionalString` has a value. If that line is reached, you can know for sure that `unwrapped` has a value that you can use, which makes that code safe.
