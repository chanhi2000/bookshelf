<!-- TODO: 작성 -->

<!-- 
Most users think about angles in terms of degrees from 0 to 360, but internally most of iOS works in radians so you’ll need to do some conversion. The equation to convert between the two is simple enough: multiply the number by Pi, then divide the result by 180.

To make things easier, drop in this function:

```swift
func deg2rad(_ number: Double) -> Double {
    return number * .pi / 180
}
```

You can now use `deg2rad(90)` to find 90 degrees in radians.
