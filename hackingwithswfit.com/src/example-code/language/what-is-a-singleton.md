<!-- 
Singletons are objects that should only ever be created once, then shared everywhere they need to be used. They are common on Apple’s platforms: `FileManager`, `UserDefaults`, `UIApplication`, and `UIAccelerometer` are all mostly used through their singleton implementations.

The basic implementation of a Swift singleton looks like this:

```swift
class Settings {
    static let shared = Settings()
    var username: String?

    private init() { }
}
```

Adding a `private` initializer is important, because it stops other parts of our code from trying to create a `Settings` class instance. However, the class creates its own instance of itself as a static variable, which means the only instance of the `Settings` class is the one it created: `Settings.shared`.
