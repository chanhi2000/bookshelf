<!-- 
Swift 2.2 introduced the ability to compare two tuples up to arity six, which means the tuples can contain no more than six elements. To compare tuples, just use the `==` operator, like this:

```swift
let singer = ("Taylor", "Swift")
let alien = ("Justin", "Bieber")

if singer == alien {
    print("Matching tuples!")
} else {
    print("Non-matching tuples!")
}
```

**Warning:** if you use labels, these are not evaluated when comparing two tuples. So, the code below will print "Matching tuples!" even though the labels are different:

```swift
let taylor = (first: "Taylor", last: "Swift")
let bird = (name: "Taylor", type: "Swift")

if taylor == bird {
    print("Matching tuples!")
} else {
    print("Non-matching tuples!")
}
```
