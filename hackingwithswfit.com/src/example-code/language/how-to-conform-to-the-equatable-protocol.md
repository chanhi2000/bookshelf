<!-- 
The `Equatable` protocol is what allows two objects to be compared using `==`, and it’s surprisingly easy to implement because Swift does most of the work for you by default.

First, here’s a struct we can work with:

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: String
}
```

To make that `Equatable` you need to add the `Equatable` conformance like this:

```swift
struct Person: Equatable {
    var name: String
    var age: String
}
```

If you don’t want to check all properties for equality, or if any of your properties are not also `Equatable`, then you need to write your own `==` function like this:

```swift
static func ==(lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {
    return lhs.name == rhs.name && lhs.age == rhs.age
}
```

Put that *inside* the `Person` struct. Because that’s your own function you can make it do any comparisons you like. Swift’s default `Equatable` implementation will check all properties for equality, so if you have one property that is guaranteed to be unique adding your own `Equatable` implementation is a good idea.
