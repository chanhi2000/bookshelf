Associated types are a powerful way of making protocols generic, but they can be a bit confusing at first. In essence, they mark holes in protocols that must be filled by whatever types conform to those protocols.

Let’s start with a simple example: an `ItemStoring` protocol that can store items in an array. What *type* those items are depends on whatever conforms to the protocol, but we can still use them inside the protocol and any extensions.

Here’s the basic protocol:

```swift
protocol ItemStoring {
    associatedtype DataType

    var items: [DataType] { get set}
    mutating func add(item: DataType)
}
```

As you can see, it requires that conforming types provide an `items` array that holds an array of whatever is used to fill the `DataType` hole, and also a mutating method to add items of that type.

That mutating method is probably going to be the same for all conforming types, so we can write a protocol extension that provides a default implementation:

```swift
extension ItemStoring {
    mutating func add(item: DataType) {
        items.append(item)
    }
}
```

Finally we can create a `NameDatabase` struct that conforms to the `ItemStoring` protocol like this:

```swift
struct NameDatabase: ItemStoring {
    var items = [String]()
}
```

Swift is smart enough to realize that `String` is being used to fill the hole in the associated type, because the `items` array must be whatever `DataType` is.

That’s all the code written, so you can go ahead and use `NameDatabase`:

```swift
var names = NameDatabase()
names.add(item: "James")
names.add(item: "Jess")
```
