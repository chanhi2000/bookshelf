iOS lets you track the battery level and status of the device you’re running on, which is helpful if you’re overlaying some sort of battery indicator over your user interface. You could even write a trivial app to detect power outages just by plugging in a spare phone then waiting for the charge state to change.

To get started, first enable the `isBatteryMonitoringEnabled` property of the current device, like this:

```swift
UIDevice.current.isBatteryMonitoringEnabled = true
```

You can now read the current battery level as a value between 0.0 (flat) and 1.0 (fully charged) using this:

```swift
let level = UIDevice.current.batteryLevel
```

If you want to be notified every time the battery level changes you can register for the `UIDeviceBatteryLevelDidChange` notification (sent up to once a minute), and you can also register for `UIDeviceBatteryStateDidChange` notification to see when the charge state changes. Both of those require `isBatteryMonitoringEnabled` to be enabled.
