<!--
When the user starts touching an iOS screen, `touchesBegan()` is immediately called with a set of `UITouches`. If you want to find where the user touched, you need to take one of those touches then use `location(in:)` on it, like this:

```swift
override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent?) {
    if let touch = touches.first {
        let position = touch.location(in: view)
        print(position)
    }
}
```

That will make `position` a `CGPoint` representing where the user touched in the current view. You can if you want pass a different view to `location(in:)`, and it will tell you where the touch was relative to that other view instead.
