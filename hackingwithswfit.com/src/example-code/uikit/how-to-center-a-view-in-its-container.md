There are two ways to center one `UIView` inside another, depending on whether you use Auto Layout.

If you don’t use Auto Layout, it’s only one line of code:

```swift
childView.center = parentView.center
```

That sets the position once, so it won’t update when your user rotates their device or if they use something like Slide Over to change the size of your app.

If you’re using Auto Layout, you can center your child view inside its parent like this:

```swift
childView.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parentView.centerXAnchor).isActive = true
childView.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: parentView.centerYAnchor).isActive = true
```

Those constraints will automatically update as the available space changes.
