<!--
The `UIProgressView` class has a built-in `setProgress()` method that adjusts its progress with animation, but by default you don’t have control over the timing of that animation.

Fortunately, if you want to time the animation to match other aspects of your user interface you can wrap it inside an animation block of your own.

For example, given a `UIProgressView` stored in a `progressView` property, this will animate the progress view to completion over four seconds:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 4.0) {
    self.progressView.setProgress(1.0, animated: true)
}
```
