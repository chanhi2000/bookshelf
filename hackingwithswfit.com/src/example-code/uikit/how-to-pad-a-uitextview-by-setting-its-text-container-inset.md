<!--
You can force the text of any `UITextView` to have padding - i.e., to be indented from its edges - by setting its `textContainerInset` property to a value of your choosing. For example, to give a text view insets of 50 points from each edge, you would use this code:

```swift
textView.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 50, left: 50, bottom: 50, right: 50)
```
