Segues are a visual way to connect various components on your storyboard, but sometimes it’s important to be able to trigger them programmatically as well as after a user interaction.

Fortunately, it only takes two steps. First, select a segue in your storyboard, then go to the attributes inspector and give it a name such as “showDetail”.

Now head to your Swift code, to the place where you want to trigger the segue you just named. The method you need to call is `performSegue()`, which exists on all view controllers: pass it a segue identifier as well as whatever object you want to send along, and you’re done:

```swift
performSegue(withIdentifier: "showDetail", sender: nil)
```

Technically the `sender` parameter is whatever triggered the segue, but you can put whatever you want in there.
