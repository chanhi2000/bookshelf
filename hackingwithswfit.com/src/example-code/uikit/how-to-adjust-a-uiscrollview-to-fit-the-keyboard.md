If your user interface brings up the keyboard, you should respond by adjusting your layout so that all parts are still visible. If you're using a `UIScrollView` or any classes that have a scroll view as part of their layout (table views and text views, for example), this means adjusting the `contentInset` property to account for the keyboard.

First you need to register for keyboard change notifications. Put this into your `viewDidLoad()` method:

```swift
let notificationCenter = NotificationCenter.default
notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(adjustForKeyboard), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification, object: nil)
notificationCenter.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(adjustForKeyboard), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillChangeFrameNotification, object: nil)
```

Now add this method somewhere else in your class:

```swift
@objc func adjustForKeyboard(notification: Notification) {
    guard let keyboardValue = notification.userInfo?[UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as? NSValue else { return }

    let keyboardScreenEndFrame = keyboardValue.cgRectValue
    let keyboardViewEndFrame = view.convert(keyboardScreenEndFrame, from: view.window)

    if notification.name == UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification {
        yourTextView.contentInset = .zero
    } else {
        yourTextView.contentInset = UIEdgeInsets(top: 0, left: 0, bottom: keyboardViewEndFrame.height - view.safeAreaInsets.bottom, right: 0)
    }

    yourTextView.scrollIndicatorInsets = yourTextView.contentInset

    let selectedRange = yourTextView.selectedRange
    yourTextView.scrollRangeToVisible(selectedRange)
}
```

That example code is for adjusting text views. If you want it to apply to a regular scroll view, just take out the last two lines - they are in there so that the text view readjusts itself so the user doesn't lose their place while editing.

**Note:** It’s important to subtract `view.safeAreaInsets.bottom` from the keyboard height to avoid making your text view too small on devices with a home indicator.
