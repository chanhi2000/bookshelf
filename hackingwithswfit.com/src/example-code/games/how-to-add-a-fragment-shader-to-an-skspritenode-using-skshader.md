Fragment shaders let you adjust individual pixels inside sprites to create effects such as embossing, pixellation, and even water, and you can attach fragment shader to any `SKSpriteNode` just by setting its `shader` property.

First, you need a fragment shader. This should be a file in your bundle with the extension “fsh”, and should be written in GLSL - the OpenGL shading language. I’m not going to teach GLSL here, but I do want to give you an example. Here’s a commented example that causes all colors in a sprite to be inverted:

```swift
void main() {
    // find the current pixel color
    vec4 current_color = texture2D(u_texture, v_tex_coord);

    // if it's not transparent
    if (current_color.a > 0.0) {
        // subtract its current RGB values from 1 and use its current alpha; multiply by the node alpha so we can fade in or out
        gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0 - current_color.rgb, current_color.a) * current_color.a * v_color_mix.a;
    } else {
        // use the current (transparent) color
        gl_FragColor = current_color;
    }
}
```

Save that as “inverted.fsh” and put it in your bundle. When you want to assign that to a sprite node, just set its `shader` property like this:

```swift
yourSprite.shader = SKShader(filename: "inverted")
```

Shaders are compiled on the device at runtime, which means they always take advantage of all GPU features on the user’s device. However, it also means there will be a small performance hit while your shader is being compiled, so it’s a good idea to compile them ahead of time and keep a cache.

If you’d like to explore shaders more, I made a whole library of them called ShaderKit. All examples are extensively commented and free to use: <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/ShaderKit">https://github.com/twostraws/ShaderKit</a>.
