One of the great features of SpriteKit's actions is that they can be chained together using action sequences. SpriteKit automatically ensures each action finishes before the next one begins - all you need to do is create the actions then put them into an array.

The example below makes a spaceship shrink down to 10% of its original size before fading out:

```swift
let sprite = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed:"Spaceship")

let scale = SKAction.scale(to: 0.1, duration: 0.5)
let fade = SKAction.fadeOut(withDuration: 0.5)
let sequence = SKAction.sequence([scale, fade])

sprite.run(sequence)
```
