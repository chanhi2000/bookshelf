<!-- 
A so-called “fair” random number generator is one that generates each of its possible values in equal amounts and with an even distribution. For example, if you were generating numbers between 1 and 4, you might get 4, 2, 1, 3, but you would never get 4 4 1 4.

GameplayKit has support for fair random number generation using `GKShuffledDistribution`. First, add an import for the GameplayKit framework:

```swift
import GameplayKit
```

Second, create an instance of `GKShuffledDistribution`, telling it the lowest and highest values it can generate:

```swift
let distribution = GKShuffledDistribution(lowestValue: 1, highestValue: 8)
```

Finally, call `nextInt()` on it as needed to generate numbers. You should get all numbers between 1 and 8 at least once before you see any repeated.
