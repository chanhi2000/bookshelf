<!-- 
If you have an array of strings and want to merge all the elements together into a single string, it's just one line of code in Swift thanks to the `joined()` method.

For example, this joins array elements with a comma:

```swift
let array = ["Andrew", "Ben", "John", "Paul", "Peter", "Laura"]
let joined = array.joined(separator: ", ")
```

The result is that `joined` is set to "Andrew, Ben, John, Paul, Peter, Laura".

If you called `joined()` without any parameters it will just stitch the strings together with no separators.
