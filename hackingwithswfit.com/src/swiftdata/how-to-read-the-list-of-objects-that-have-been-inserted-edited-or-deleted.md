SwiftData can get confused if you accidentally attempt to insert the same object instance twice, which can sometimes happen when working with relationships. To avoid problems, you can check one of three properties in your model context to see exactly what data has been changed since the last save:

- Read `insertedModelsArray` to see which model objects have been created.
- Read `changedModelsArray` to see which model objects have been edited.
- Read `deletedModelsArray` to see which model objects have been deleted, or read `isDeleted` directly on a model object.

Each of these have equivalents in Core Data's `NSManagedObject`: `isInserted`, `isUpdated`, or `isDeleted`.

Alternatively, you can read the `hasChanges` property of a model object, which will be true if the object has been inserted, deleted, or edited since the last save.
