> Updated for Xcode 15

Core Data allowed us to create indexes for faster searching, so rather than having to look through every row for a particular piece of data it could just consult the index and get the answer in a fraction of the time.

**SwiftData does not support custom indexes.**

They just aren't a thing, at least not yet. Obviously I'm hoping this will change soon because indexes are critically important when dealing with large data sets.

Fingers crossed…
