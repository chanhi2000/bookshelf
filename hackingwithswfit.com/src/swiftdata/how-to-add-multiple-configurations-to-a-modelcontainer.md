For more advanced SwiftData setups, it’s possible to send multiple model configurations into a single model container, giving you fine-grained control over how each part of your schema is manipulated.

::: important

SwiftData models with relationships *must* be part of the same store. For example, if a `User` model has a relationship with a `Recipe` model, SwiftData will not let you create a configuration for one that excludes the other - even if you exclude one, it will implicitly be added by SwiftData. To be clear, relationships *cannot* span multiple SwiftData stores.

:::

For example, you might want to store `Recipe` objects permanently, but download `Comment` objects into a temporary store for faster access:

```swift
@main
struct RecipeBookApp: App {
    var container: ModelContainer

    init() {
        do {
            let config1 = ModelConfiguration(for: Recipe.self)
            let config2 = ModelConfiguration(for: Comment.self, isStoredInMemoryOnly: true)

            container = try ModelContainer(for: Recipe.self, Comment.self, configurations: config1, config2)
        } catch {
            fatalError("Failed to configure SwiftData container.")
        }
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .modelContainer(container)
    }
}
```

Again, if those two model types were linked through a relationship, SwiftData would have no choice but to load both types in both configurations.
