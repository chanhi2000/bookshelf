> Updated for Xcode 15

The `@Attribute` macro has a `.spotlight` option that, on paper at least, automatically indexes a property in Spotlight. If you look at other folks writing about this attribute that’s what they’ll say, but as far as I can tell this attribute does *nothing at all*.

If you actually *try* it you’ll see for yourself that it does nothing: the data is stored in a regular SQLite database, and isn’t magically visible to Spotlight searches.

In Core Data we were able to use `NSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate` to trigger spotlight indexing of Spotlight-enabled data, but this is not currently an option for SwiftData apps.

Maybe I’m just “holding it wrong”, but if you’ve found a solution please let me know!

In the meantime, your only option is to use a Core Data coexistence solution and use `NSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate` as before to index your data.
