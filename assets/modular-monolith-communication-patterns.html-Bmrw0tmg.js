Components are deeply intertwined. Making a change in one component impacts many others. Introducing new features is difficult and error-prone.</p><p>Modular monoliths aim to solve these problems.</p><figure><img src="https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_049/modular_monolith_diagram.png?imwidth=3840" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A Modular monolith consists of many <strong>loosely coupled</strong> modules. Modules represent cohesive sets of functionalities. Modules are also <strong>independent</strong> of each other.</p><p>Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>Payments module</li><li>Shipping module</li><li>Booking module</li><li>Reviews module</li></ul><p>If this concept reminds you of Microservices, that&#39;s because it should.</p><p>Microservices represent self-contained services encapsulating a set of functionalities of the larger system, much like modules in a Modular monolith.</p><p>For a Modular monolith to be loosely coupled, you need to solve how modules will communicate.</p><p>Modules cannot reference each other directly except through their public APIs.</p><p>There are two widely used communication patterns. Both have pros and cons and a set of tradeoffs that you need to understand.</p><hr><h2 id="synchronous-communication-with-method-calls" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#synchronous-communication-with-method-calls"><span>Synchronous Communication With Method Calls</span></a></h2><p>The first and easiest communication pattern is simple <strong>method calls</strong> between modules. Method calls are <strong>synchronous</strong> and very fast because they&#39;re in memory.</p><p>Module A calls a method declared on the <strong>public API</strong> of Module B and waits until it receives a result.</p><p>Each module exposes a <strong>public API</strong>, which can be an <code>interface</code> in .NET.</p><p>The module will implement this interface internally and hide any implementation details. You can use the <code>internal</code> keyword to make the implementation inaccessible outside the module.</p><p>Modules depend on the interfaces at compile-time. At runtime, <strong>dependency injection</strong> will provide the respective implementation.</p><figure><img src="https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_049/modular_monolith_sync_communication.png?imwidth=3840" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The benefits of this approach are:</p><ul><li>Speed of in-memory calls</li><li>Easy to implement</li><li>No indirection</li></ul><p>But, the drawback of this approach is <strong>strong coupling</strong>.</p><p><strong>Synchronous communication</strong> means that the modules will be tightly coupled. If one of the modules is unavailable, it will affect any dependent modules. You can introduce a retry mechanism, but this only goes so far.</p><hr><h2 id="asynchronous-communication-with-messaging" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#asynchronous-communication-with-messaging"><span>Asynchronous Communication With Messaging</span></a></h2><p>The second communication pattern is asynchronous <strong>messaging</strong> between modules.</p><p>Module A sends a message to the message broker in a fire-and-forget fashion. Module B subscribes to relevant messages and handles them accordingly.</p><p>Modules don&#39;t need to know about each other, but they do need to know about the message contracts.</p><p><strong>Message contracts</strong> are the <strong>public API</strong> of a module in this scenario.</p><figure><img src="https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_049/modular_monolith_async_communication.png?imwidth=3840" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The benefits of this approach are:</p><ul><li>High availability</li><li>Loose coupling</li></ul><p><strong>Asynchronous communication</strong> gives us loose coupling because modules communicate using messages. Module B doesn&#39;t need to be available for Module A to send a message.</p><p>The obvious drawback of this approach is <strong>increased complexity</strong>.</p><p>We&#39;re introducing a <strong>message broker</strong> to the system.

But it&#39;s more complex to implement.</p><p>So which <strong>communication pattern</strong> should you be using?</p><p>It depends.</p><p>Asynchronous communication can help you build <strong>loosely coupled</strong> and <strong>independent</strong> modules.
