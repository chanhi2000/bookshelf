To see why this is significant, let’s take a whirlwind tour of how web development evolved over the last 10 or so years.</p><p>Prior to RSC, JavaScript frameworks (React, Svelte, Vue, Solid, etc) provided you with a component model for building your application. These components were capable of running on the server, but only as a synchronous operation for stringifying your components’ HTML to send down to the browser so it could server render your app. Your app would then render in the browser, again, at which point it would become interactive. With this model, the only way to load data was as a side-effect on the client. Waiting until your app reached your user’s browser before beginning to load data was<strong>slow and inefficient</strong>.</p><p>To solve this inefficiency, meta-frameworks like Next, SvelteKit, Remix, Nuxt, SolidStart, etc were created. These meta-frameworks provided various ways to load data, server-side, with that data being injected by the meta-framework into your component tree. This code was non-portable, and usually a little awkward. You’d have to define some sort of loader function that was associated with a given route, load data, and then expect it to show up in your component tree based on the rules of whatever meta-framework you were using.</p><p>This worked, but it wasn’t without issue. In addition to being framework-specific, composition also suffered; where typically components are explicitly passed props by whichever component renders them, now there are<em>implicit</em>props passed by the meta-framework, based on what you return from your loader. Nor was this setup the most flexible. A given page needs to know what data it needs up front, and request it all from the loader. With client-rendered SPAs we could just render whatever components we need, and let them fetch whatever data they need. This was awful for performance, but amazing for convenience.</p><p>RSC bridges that gap and gives us the best of both worlds. We get to<em>ad hoc</em>request whatever data we need from whichever component we’re rendering, but have that code execute on the server, without needing to wait for a round trip to the browser. Best of all, RSC also supports<em>streaming</em>, or more precisely,<em>out-of-order</em>streaming. If some of our data are slow to load, we can send the rest of the page, and<em>push</em>those data down to the browser, from the server, whenever they happen to be ready.</p><hr><h2 id="how-do-i-use-them" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-use-them"><span>How do I use them?</span></a></h2>',9)),t(o,{name:"arackaf/my-blog",desc:"my-blog-arackaf.vercel.app",url:"https://github.com/arackaf/my-blog/blob/feature/rsc-react-query/blog/rsc-and-react-query/index.md#how-do-i-use-them",logo:"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-dark.svg",preview:"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/0eb5cb848c13ec632de5a627b2ae42efc22417b6f98d0a03f162f89bc240433f/arackaf/my-blog"}),a("p",null,[n[26]||(n[26]=s("At time of writing RSC are mostly only supported in Next.js, although the minimal framework",-1)),a("a",S,[t(l,{icon:"fas fa-globe"}),n[25]||(n[25]=s("Waku",-1))]),n[27]||(n[27]=s("also supports it.

Then we see a Suspense boundary. This is how out-of-order streaming works with Next and RSC. Everything above the Suspense boundary will render immediately, and the<code>Loading...</code>message will show until all the various data in the various components below have finished loading. React knows what’s pending based on what you’ve awaited. The<code>Books</code>,<code>Subjects</code>and<code>Tags</code>components all have fetches inside of them, which are awaited. We’ll look at one of them momentarily, but first note that, even though three different components are all requesting data, React will run them in parallel. Sibling nodes in the component tree can, and do load data in parallel.</p><p>But if you ever have a parent / child component which both load data, then the child component will not (cannot) even<em>start</em>util the parent is finished loading. If the child data fetch depends on the parent’s loaded data, then this is unavoidable (you’d have to modify your backend to fix it), but if the data do not depend on each other, then you would solve this waterfall by just loading the data higher up in the component tree, and passing the various pieces down.</p><h3 id="loading-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#loading-data"><span>Loading data</span></a></h3>`,4)),t(o,{name:"arackaf/my-blog",desc:"my-blog-arackaf.vercel.app",url:"https://github.com/arackaf/my-blog/blob/feature/rsc-react-query/blog/rsc-and-react-query/index.md#loading-data",logo:"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-dark.svg",preview:"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/0eb5cb848c13ec632de5a627b2ae42efc22417b6f98d0a03f162f89bc240433f/arackaf/my-blog"}),n[109]||(n[109]=i(`<p>Let’s see the Books component”</p><div class="language-jsx line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="jsx"><pre><code class="language-jsx"><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token constant">FC</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token keyword">from</span> <span class="token string">&quot;react&quot;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span>

We only called<code>revalidateTag</code>on our books, not our subjects or tags. The problem is that<code>revalidateTag</code>doesn’t tell Next what to reload, it tells it what to eject from its cache. The fact is, Next needs to reload everything for the current page when we call<code>revalidateTag</code>. This makes sense when you think about what’s really happening. These server components are not stateful; they run on the server, but they don’t<em>live</em>on the server. The request executes on our server, those RSCs render, and send down the markup, and that’s that. The component tree does not live on indefinitely on the server; our servers wouldn’t scale very well if they did!</p><p>So how do we solve this? For a use case like this, the solution would be to<em>not</em>turn off caching. We’d lean on Next’s caching mechanisms, whatever they look like when you happen to read this. We’d cache each of these data with different tags, and invalidate the tag related to the data we just updated.</p><p>The whole RSC tree will still re-render when we do that, but the requests for cached data would run quickly. Personally, I’m of the view that caching should be a performance tweak you add, as needed; it should not be a<em>sine qua non</em>for avoiding slow updates.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s yet another problem with server actions: they run serially. Only one server action can be in flight at a time; they’ll queue if you try to violate this constraint.</p><p>This sounds genuinely unbelievable; but it’s true. If we artificially slow down our update a LOT, and then quickly click 5 different save buttons, we’ll see horrifying things in our network tab. If the extreme slowdown on the update endpoint seems unfair on my part, remember: you should never,<em>ever</em>assume your network will be fast, or even reliable. Occasional, slow network requests are inevitable, and server actions will do the worst possible thing under those circumstances.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/serial-execution-1024x94.jpg?resize=1024%2C94&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is a known issue, and will presumably be fixed at some point.

Remember, with server actions, calling<code>revalidateTag</code>will cause your entire component tree to re-render, which by extension will re-request all their various data. If you don’t have everything cached (on the server) properly, it’s very easy for this single round trip to take longer than the two round trips react-query needs. I say this from experience. I recently helped a friend / founder build a financial dashboard app. I had react-query set up just like this, and also implemented a server action to update a piece of data. And I had the same data rendered, and updated twice: once in an RSC, and again adjacently in a client component from a<code>useSuspenseQuery</code>hook. I basically fired off a race to see which would update first, certain the server action would, but was<em>shocked</em>to see react-query win. I initially thought I’d done something wrong until I realized what was happening (and hastened to roll back my server action work).</p><hr><h2 id="playing-on-hard-mode" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#playing-on-hard-mode"><span>Playing on hard mode</span></a></h2>',4)),t(o,{name:"arackaf/my-blog",desc:"my-blog-arackaf.vercel.app",url:"https://github.com/arackaf/my-blog/blob/feature/rsc-react-query/blog/rsc-and-react-query/index.md#playing-on-hard-mode",logo:"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-dark.svg",preview:"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/0eb5cb848c13ec632de5a627b2ae42efc22417b6f98d0a03f162f89bc240433f/arackaf/my-blog"}),n[123]||(n[123]=a("p",null,"There’s one obnoxious imperfection hiding.
