With this approach, we will have to set up a new worker from the start each time.</p><p>There is a lot of overhead cost that is required when creating a worker, starting the thread, and the memory overhead of creating a new worker head, and additional resources that are required to manage each thread. Although tasks can be implemented while using the first approach, it isn’t an efficient approach — especially when implementing large-scale Node based systems. To cater to the pain points that arise with this approach, there is another way that is also a standard industry practice.</p><p>The second way is to implement a worker pool. A worker pool solves the pain points of the first approach by creating a tool of worker threads that can be reused for multiple tasks. Instead of creating a worker thread each time, we can instead create a pool and assign the tasks to workers inside them.</p><p>In technical terms, a worker pool can be considered as an abstract data type that manages a pool of worker threads. Each worker thread in the pool is assigned a task and the thread runs the task in parallel to the other threads.</p><p>There are multiple ways of assigning tasks. The worker pool also acts as a manager by distributing tasks to the worker threads, collecting results from them, and enabling communication between those that are present in that worker pool.</p><p>A worker pool can be implemented by using different data structures and algorithms i.e, task queue and message passing systems. The choice of using a specific data structure depends on the requirements i.e, a number of worker threads required, the exact nature of the task, and how much communication between the threads is needed.</p><h3 id="implementing-the-worker-pool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#implementing-the-worker-pool"><span>Implementing the worker pool</span></a></h3><p>In Node, a worker pool can be implemented by using built-in features or by using third-party tools.

Firstly, we are importing the necessary members from the module and then, if the current execution context is in the main thread, we are creating an array to store four workers. After the creation of each worker, this code sends a new message to each of the worker threads with a task to be performed.</p><p>In the worker thread portion, we are listening for the messages from the main thread by using the <code>on</code> method of the <code>parentPort</code> property. After receiving the message, it logs the process id with the task and passes it on to a function performing the task that will apply appropriate methods to the task.</p><hr><h2 id="what-are-the-main-benefits-of-using-threads" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-main-benefits-of-using-threads"><span>What are the main benefits of using threads?</span></a></h2><p>In essence, threads are a valuable tool that can significantly impact the performance, responsiveness, and overall efficiency of a program. When utilized effectively, they can make a big difference in the outcome of a program and help it keep pace with user demands.</p><p>Threading in Node.js is a powerful tool for developers. It allows them to split a process into multiple, completely autonomous execution streams. If used correctly, threading can improve the quality of a program by enhancing its speed, efficiency, and responsiveness.</p><p>Some of the main advantages of threading are:</p><ol><li><strong>Improved performance</strong>: Instead of just running one task, threads facilitate the running of multiple programs concurrently and thus allows the faster execution of the whole program</li><li><strong>Responsiveness</strong>: If a task is compute-heavy, it will block or delay the execution of the rest of the operations, delaying the execution of the whole program. With threading, if a compute-heavy task is taking time and delaying the response from one thread, it won’t affect the responsiveness of the program as other threads can continue to handle user input and other tasks</li><li><strong>Resource sharing</strong>: In Node.js, due to process-level global scope and inter-process communication, multiple threads can share resources. Sharing of resources helps multiple threads in accessing and modifying shared data i.e, variables, thus allowing concurrent processing which results in faster execution of the program</li><li><strong>Ease of programming</strong>: With the introduction of threading, programmers don’t have to worry about the limitations of the single-threaded architecture of Node.js, making programming efficient and scalable</li><li><strong>Improved scalability</strong>: It is easy and efficient to scale threads, thus they make it easier to build high-performance and scalable Node.js applications that can handle the increased load without any difficulty</li></ol><hr><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2><p><code>worker_threads</code> provide a fairly easy way to add multi-threading support to our applications. By delegating heavy CPU computations to other threads, we can significantly increase our server’s throughput. With the official threads support, we can expect more developers and engineers from fields like AI, machine learning, and big data to start using Node.js.</p>`,51)),w(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),s(i,d(u({title:"A complete guide to threads in Node.js",desc:"While it is single-threaded, Node.js uses worker threads that allow for a separate execution thread that runs alongside the main thread.",link:"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-threads-node-js.html",logo:"/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/favicon.png",background:"rgba(112,76,182,0.2)"})),null,16)])}const W=m(b,[["render",A]]),P=JSON.parse('{"path":"/blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-threads-node-js.html","title":"A complete guide to threads in Node.js","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"A complete guide to threads in Node.js","description":"Article(s) > A complete guide to threads in Node.js","icon":"fa-brands fa-node","category":["Node.js","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","blog.logrocket.com","node","nodejs","node-js"],"head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"A complete guide to threads in Node.js\\",\\"image\\":[\\"https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complete-guide-threads-node-js.png\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Maciej Cieślar\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.logrocket.com/author/maciejcieslar/\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-threads-node-js.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"📚Bookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"A complete guide to threads in Node.js"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > A complete guide to threads in Node.js"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complete-guide-threads-node-js.png"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:src","content":"https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complete-guide-threads-node-js.png"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:alt","content":"A complete guide to threads in Node.js"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Maciej Cieślar"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"node-js"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"nodejs"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"node"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog.logrocket.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z"}],[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > A complete guide to threads in Node.js"},{"property":"og:description","content":"A complete guide to threads in Node.js"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-threads-node-js.html"}]],"prev":"/programming/js-node/articles/README.md","date":"2023-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false,"author":[{"name":"Maciej Cieślar","url":"https://blog.logrocket.com/author/maciejcieslar/"}],"cover":"https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/complete-guide-threads-node-js.png"},"git":{},"readingTime":{"minutes":9.24,"words":2773},"filePathRelative":"blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-threads-node-js.md","copyright":{"author":"Maciej Cieślar"}}');export{W as comp,P as data};
