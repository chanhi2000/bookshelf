This case falls within an error handling where the browser will scale the radius until we can have a circle that meets the condition. Instead of considering this case as invalid, the browser will fix “our mistake” and draw an arc.</p><p>This error handling is pretty cool as it allows us to simplify our <code>shape()</code> function. Instead of specifying the exact radius, I simply put a small value and the browser will do the job for me. This trick only works when the arc we want to draw is half a circle. Don’t try to apply it with any <code>arc</code> command because it won’t always work.</p><p>Another optimization is to update the following:</p><div class="language-css line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="css"><pre><code class="language-css"><span class="line">arc to <span class="token function">calc</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>50% + <span class="token function">var</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>--r<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> 0 of 1%<span class="token punctuation">,</span></span>

It’s logical to think about six arcs since we have six curves, but three of them can be done with a simple border radius, so only three arcs are needed. Always take the time to analyze the shape you are creating. Sometimes, basic CSS properties can help with creating the shape.</p><p>What are you waiting for? This is your next homework and I won’t help you with a figure this time. You have all that you need to easily create it.
