The business needed to keep running during the transition. No downtime. No data loss. No disruption to daily operations.</p><p>This wasn&#39;t just a technical challenge. It was a lesson in managing complexity, understanding legacy business processes, and navigating organizational dynamics.</p><p>So here&#39;s that story and the lessons learned.</p><hr><h2 id="initial-state-understanding-the-legacy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#initial-state-understanding-the-legacy"><span>Initial State: Understanding the Legacy</span></a></h2><p>The first challenge was understanding how this massive system actually worked. The codebase had grown organically over four decades, maintained by a single development team. They were now in their 60s and looking to retire.</p><p>Walking into the first codebase review was like opening a time capsule. APL&#39;s concise syntax meant that complex business logic could be written in just a few lines. Beautiful, if you could read it. Terrifying, if you couldn&#39;t. And most of us couldn&#39;t.</p><p>The original team was invaluable during the knowledge transfer. They knew every quirk, every special case, every business rule that had been added over the decades. But there&#39;s only so much you can learn from conversations. Documentation was sparse. What existed was outdated. The real documentation was in the heads of the original developers.</p><p>We spent weeks mapping the system&#39;s functionality:</p><ul><li>The core manufacturing process was spread across 50+ tables with complex interdependencies</li><li>Inventory management touched nearly every part of the system</li><li>Custom reporting tools have been built over decades to meet specific business needs</li><li>Integration points with external components were handled through a maze of stored procedures</li></ul><p>Tables that started with basic schemas had grown to include hundreds of columns. Some columns were no longer used but couldn&#39;t be removed because no one was sure if some obscure report still needed them.</p><p>What made this particularly challenging was the disconnect between the business processes and their technical implementation. The business would describe a simple workflow, but the technical implementation would reveal layers of complexity added over years of edge cases and special requirements.</p><p>We needed a systematic approach to understanding this beast. We started by mapping business processes and their corresponding technical implementations. This helped us identify the core domains that would later influence our modular architecture. More importantly, it helped us understand the true scope of what we were dealing with.</p><hr><h2 id="the-product-vs-engineering-conflict" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-product-vs-engineering-conflict"><span>The Product vs. Engineering Conflict</span></a></h2><p>Management wanted quick wins. They pushed us to start with the simplest components. This created tension between product management and the development team.</p><p>Product management&#39;s perspective was straightforward: show progress to the business. They needed visible results to justify the investment in the rewrite. The business was spending significant money, and they wanted to see returns quickly.</p><p>The development team saw a different reality. We knew that starting with peripheral features meant building on shaky ground. The core business logic would remain in the legacy system, making every integration point more complex. This technical debt would compound over time.</p><p>As a technical lead, I strongly opposed this approach. My argument was simple: the core manufacturing process was the heart of the system. Every peripheral feature depended on it. By postponing its migration, we created a tangled web of dependencies between old and new systems. Each new feature we migrated would need complex synchronization with the legacy core. We were building on quicksand.</p><p>I advocated for focusing on the core domain first. Yes, it would take longer to show the first results. But it would create a solid foundation for everything that followed. The business would have to wait longer for visible progress, but the overall migration would be faster and more reliable.</p><p>Neither side was wrong in their objectives. Product management had valid concerns about showing progress. The development team had valid concerns about technical sustainability. But this misalignment led to compromises that impacted the project timeline. To this day, I believe we would have finished the migration sooner if we had started with the core business logic.</p><hr><h2 id="software-architecture-building-for-the-future" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#software-architecture-building-for-the-future"><span>Software Architecture: Building for the Future</span></a></h2>',24)),t("p",null,[e[14]||(e[14]=n("During the discovery phase, we identified distinct business domains within the system.
