The list IT admins have being waiting for. The ten most common questions (and their answers) from IT Admins.</p><details class="hint-container details"><summary>1. So what exactly is Docker? Something about “container applications” right?</summary><p>Docker is an open platform that both IT operations teams and Developer team use to build, ship and run their applications, giving them the agility, portability and control that each team requires across the software supply chain. We have created a standard Docker container that packages up an application, with everything that the applications requires to run. This standardization allows teams to containerize applications and run them in any environment, on any infrastructure and to be written in any language</p></details><details class="hint-container details"><summary>2. What is a Docker container and how is it different than a VM? Does containerization replace my virtualization infrastructure?</summary><p>Containerization is very different from virtualization. It starts with the Docker engine, the tool that creates and runs containers (1 or more), and is the Docker installed software on any physical, virtual or cloud host with a compatible OS. Containerization leverages the kernel within the host operating system to run multiple root file systems. We call these root file systems “containers.” Each container shares the kernel within the host OS, allowing you to run multiple Docker containers on the same host. Unlike VMs, containers do not have an OS within it. They simply share the underlying kernel with the other containers. Each container running on a host is completely isolated so applications running on the same host are unaware of each other (you can use Docker Networking to create a multi-host overlay network that enables containers running on hosts to speak to one another).</p><p>The image below shows containerization on the left and virtualization on the right. Notice how containerization (left), unlike virtualization (right) does not require a hypervisor or multiple OSs.</p><figure><img src="https://docker.com/app/uploads/2022/12/admins-ask-about-docker-2.png" alt="admins ask about docker 2" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>admins ask about docker 2</figcaption></figure><p>Docker containers and traditional VMs are not mutually exclusive, so no, containers do not have to replace VMs. Docker containers can actually run within VMs. This allows teams to containerize each service and run multiple Docker containers per vm.</p><figure><img src="https://docker.com/app/uploads/2022/12/admins-ask-about-docker-3.png" alt="admins ask about docker 3" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>admins ask about docker 3</figcaption></figure></details>',3)),t("details",D,[e[6]||(e[6]=t("summary",null,"3.
