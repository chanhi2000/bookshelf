You know, have a plan for it and write code that&#39;s mindful about adding extra weight to the page.</p><p>But not everything about performance happens directly at the code level, right? I&#39;d say many — if not most — sites and apps rely on some number of third-party scripts where we might not have any influence over the code. Analytics is a good example. Writing a hand-spun analytics tracking dashboard isn&#39;t what my clients really want to pay me for, so I&#39;ll drop in the ol&#39; Google Analytics script and maybe never think of it again.</p><p>That&#39;s one example and a common one at that. But what&#39;s also common is managing multiple third-party scripts on a single page. One of my clients is big into user tracking, so in addition to a script for analytics, they&#39;re also running third-party scripts for heatmaps, cart abandonments, and personalized recommendations — typical e-commerce stuff. All of that is dumped on any given page in one fell swoop courtesy of Google Tag Manager (GTM), which allows us to deploy and run scripts without having to go through the pain of re-deploying the entire site.</p><p>As a result, adding and executing scripts is a fairly trivial task. It is so effortless, in fact, that even non-developers on the team have contributed their own fair share of scripts, many of which I have no clue what they do. The boss wants something, and it&#39;s going to happen one way or another, and GTM facilitates that work without friction between teams.</p><p>All of this adds up to what I often hear described as a “fight for the main thread.” That&#39;s when I started hearing more performance-related jargon, like web workers, Core Web Vitals, deferring scripts, and using pre-connect, among others. <strong>But what I&#39;ve started learning is that these technical terms for performance make up an arsenal of tools to combat performance bottlenecks.</strong></p><p>The real fight, it seems, is evaluating our needs as developers and stakeholders against a user&#39;s needs, namely, the need for a fast and frictionless page load.</p><hr><h2 id="fighting-for-the-main-thread" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fighting-for-the-main-thread"><span>Fighting For The Main Thread</span></a></h2><p>We&#39;re talking about performance in the context of JavaScript, but there are lots of things that happen during a page load.

A font is a branding consideration as well as a design asset that can enhance the legibility of a site&#39;s content. Something like that might make loading a font script or file worth its cost to page performance. That&#39;s a tough one. So, rather than fully eliminating a font, maybe it can be optimized instead, perhaps by self-hosting the files rather than connecting to a third-party domain or only loading a subset of characters.</p><p>Analytics is another difficult choice.

Yes, having a persistent and convenient way for customers to get in touch with support is going to be important, particularly for e-commerce and SaaS-based services.
