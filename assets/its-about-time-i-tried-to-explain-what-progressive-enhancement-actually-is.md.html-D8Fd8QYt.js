I’ve been saying the following for years:</p><blockquote><p><strong>We build for everyone</strong>. Not just for ourselves or our peer groups.</p></blockquote><p>Do you want to build resilient front-ends? Do you want your front-end to work for everyone, regardless of browser and device? Do you want your website to work on poor connections? Do you want your website to work globally?</p><p>Have you answered yes to either or all of the above? What you need is <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-progressive-enhancement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-progressive-enhancement"><span>What is progressive enhancement?</span></a></h2><p>Let’s go for a real simple definition here.</p><p>Progressive enhancement is a design and development principle where we build in layers which automatically turn themselves on based on the browser’s capabilities. Enhancement layers are treated as off by default, resulting in a solid baseline experience that is designed to work for everyone.</p><p>We do this with a declarative approach which is already baked in to how the browser deals with HTML and CSS. For JavaScript — which is imperative — we only use it as an experience enhancer, rather than a requirement, which means only loading when the core elements of the page — HTML and CSS — are already providing a great user experience.</p><p>The idea of progressive enhancement is that <strong>everyone gets the perfect experience for them</strong>, rather than a pre-determined “perfect” experience from a design and development team. It’s a perfect experience for users because everything works, which is far from the truth — in reality — with so-called “graceful degradation”.</p><p>Graceful degradation is the opposite to progressive enhancement because a pre-determined “perfect experience” is authored then broken down with support testing strategies instead. The problem with that approach is <strong>everything can and will go wrong in the browser</strong>, so support testing strategies will unlikely never be reached in <strong>a lot of cases</strong>, which results in a broken, unresponsive user interface.</p><p>It’s why at the root of progressive enhancement is solid, organised and semantic HTML. If the absolute worst should happen with everything else on your webpage (it will, trust me), then at <em>least</em> the user gets a functional, understandable web page.</p><p>Above everything, it is better to presume the worst when building a website because when someone actually experiences the worst, they still get a good experience.</p><hr><h2 id="it-s-not-just-an-anti-javascript-thing-it-s-a-mental-model-rooted-in-iteration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#it-s-not-just-an-anti-javascript-thing-it-s-a-mental-model-rooted-in-iteration"><span>It’s not just an anti-JavaScript thing, it’s a mental model rooted in iteration</span></a></h2><p>Building with progressive enhancement principles isn’t anti-JavaScript, but rather, it <em>rightly</em> places JavaScript as a nice to have, instead of being a required technology. JavaScript is a fantastic tool to provide rich interactivity to a page, but it is — by its imperative nature — <em>fragile</em>. It’s better to enhance existing correctly working functionality than bet against that functionality working in the real world by making an imperative programming language that’s notorious for behaving poorly on the web the barrier to it.</p><p>The same goes for new CSS features. We can operate with the latest and greatest features without fear because if a browser doesn’t understand them, it’s all good because we’re building up from a <strong>minimum viable experience</strong>. Luckily CSS is a declarative programming language, so we can determine what our default and enhanced experiences are easily in the same rule a lot of the time.</p>',17)),t("p",null,[e[8]||(e[8]=n("Let’s say you want to use the new(ish) ",-1)),e[9]||(e[9]=t("code",null,"cap",-1)),e[10]||(e[10]=n(" unit.
