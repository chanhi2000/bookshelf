I’ve always liked <code>clip-path</code>. Maybe it’s because it’s such a sharp knife. When you clip an element, it’s <em>clipped</em>, yo. There isn’t a lot of nuance to it, it does what it does. But moreso, I think I like the connection to SVG (oh, hey, by the way, I just made <a href="https://practical-svg.chriscoyier.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my old book Practical SVG</a> entirely free).

You <em>could</em> do it that way, but there is a minor aesthetic issue with it. Because the <code>background-color</code> is changing here, the text also needs to change appropriately (from dark to light here). You could change that color instantly, but that will look weird like it’s changing too early. You could set a <code>transition</code> on it, but you’ll never get the fade to look quite right, especially as it has to go through an awkward gray color.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-23-at-10.09.32 AM-1024x206.png?resize=1024%2C206&amp;ssl=1" alt="Essentially, you’ll never get a state like this" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Essentially, you’ll <em>never</em> get a state like this</figcaption></figure><p>This ain’t gonna happen with an underlay element alone.</p><p>See how the text is half-light and half-dark mid-animation when the highlight blue pill moves from one to another?
