Download, install, run. Cursor smooths the landing with a one-click migration from VS Code—your extensions, themes, settings, and keybindings slide right over. Suddenly, you’re in a new editor that looks a lot like home but has some wild new tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>Once you’re settled, Cursor gives you a few ways to work with it:</p><ul><li><strong>Inline Edit (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>)</strong> – Highlight some code, and then tell Cursor what you want to happen (e.g. “Refactor this function to use async/await”), and watch Cursor suggest a tidy diff right in front of your eyes. Nothing sneaky—just a controlled, color-coded change you can approve or toss if it’s not what you had in mind.</li><li><strong>AI Chat (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>)</strong> – This is like ChatGPT, but it knows your codebase. It hands out along-side your editor panes. Ask why a component is behaving weirdly, brainstorm ideas, or generate new code blocks. By default, it sees the current file, but you can widen its gaze to the whole repo with @codebase.</li><li><strong>The Agent (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>)</strong> – For the big jobs. Describe a goal (“Add authentication with GitHub and Google”), and Cursor will plan the steps, touch multiple files, and even run commands—always asking before it does anything dangerous. This is where you go from “pair programmer” to “project collaborator.”</li></ul><h3 id="some-inspiration-for-the-quick-editor" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#some-inspiration-for-the-quick-editor"><span>Some Inspiration for the Quick Editor</span></a></h3><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png?resize=902%2C510&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The inline editor is Cursor’s scalpel—it’s sharp, precise, and surprisingly versatile once you start leaning on it. A few of my favorite quick tricks:</p><ul><li><strong>Refactor without the tedium</strong>: Highlight a callback hell nightmare, hit <kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, and ask Cursor to rewrite it with async/await. Boom—cleaner code in seconds.</li><li><strong>Generate boilerplate</strong>: Tired of writing the same prop-type interfaces or test scaffolding? Select a stub, tell Cursor what you need, and let it flesh things out.</li><li><strong>Convert styles on the fly</strong>: Need to move from plain CSS to Tailwind or from Tailwind to inline styles? Cursor can handle the translation with a single instruction.</li><li><strong>Explain before you change</strong>: Select a gnarly function and just ask Cursor “explain this.” You’ll get a quick natural-language breakdown before deciding what to tweak.</li><li><strong>Add guardrails</strong>: Highlight a function and say, “Add input validation with Zod,” or “Throw if the input is null.” Cursor will patch in the safety nets.</li></ul><p>These tricks work best when you’re hyper-specific with what you want. Think of it less like a magic wand and more like a super helpful, pair-programming buddy who thrives on clear, concrete instructions. That’s the scalpel. But Cursor also gives you bigger hammers when you need them.</p><h3 id="getting-the-most-out-of-the-chat-and-agent" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-the-most-out-of-the-chat-and-agent"><span>Getting the Most Out of the Chat and Agent</span></a></h3><p>As I alluded too above, <strong>Chat (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>)</strong> is for conversation and exploration. It’s best for asking “why” or “what if” questions, brainstorming, or generating code you’ll shape yourself. I use this all of the time to think through various approaches <em>before</em> I write any code. I treat it like a co-worker that I’m bouncing ideas off of—except I don’t have to interrupt them.</p><ul><li>Keep prompts specific (“Explain how this hook manages state across renders” beats “Explain this”).</li><li>Pull in the right context with @files or @codebase so answers stay grounded in <em>your</em> project.</li><li>Use it as a sounding board before you start refactoring—it’ll surface tradeoffs you might miss.</li></ul><p><strong>The Agent (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>)</strong> is for execution. Think of it as delegating work to a teammate who follows your plan:</p><ul><li>Start with a high-level description, then ask the agent to generate a step-by-step plan before running anything.</li><li>Approve changes incrementally—don’t green-light a sweeping set of edits unless you’ve reviewed the plan.</li><li>Pair it with tests and Git. Strong test coverage makes it easy to validate the agent’s work, and frequent commits let you roll back if things get messy.</li><li>Use it for repetitive or cross-file tasks—things that would normally take you 20 minutes of hunt-and-peck are often solved in one go.</li></ul><p>Here are some examples of things you might choose to toss at an agent:</p><ul><li>“Add authentication with GitHub and Google using Supabase. Show me the plan first.”</li><li>“Migrate all class-based components in @components to functional components with hooks.”</li><li>“Convert this component to use Tailwind classes instead of inline styles.”</li></ul><p>In short: chat is your whiteboard, agent is your task runner. Bounce ideas in chat, then graduate to the agent when you’re ready to automate.</p><hr><h2 id="why-context-is-everything" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-context-is-everything"><span>Why Context Is Everything</span></a></h2><p>In a large enough code base, you’re not going to be able to keep the entire thing in your head at any given time—and Cursor can’t either. In fact, this is probably one of the few places where you have an edge over an LLM—for now.</p><p>If you’re looking to get the most out of Cursor and other tools, then managing context is the name of the game. Sure, Cursor can index your code base, but sometimes that can be too much of a good thing. If you want to get the most out of a tool like Cursor, then you’re going to want to pull in the specific parts of your code base that you want it to know about. Otherwise, it’s hard to blame it if it starts heading off in a direction that you didn’t expect. If you didn’t explain what you wanted or give the necessary context to a human, it’s unlikely that they’re going to have what they need in order to be successful and Cursor is no different. Without context is like a smart intern working blindfolded. It might guess, it might improvise, and sometimes it invents nonsense (“hallucinations” is the fancy term). Feed it the right context, though, and Cursor becomes sharp, fast, and eerily helpful.</p><p>Context does a few magical things:</p><ul><li>Cuts down on guesswork.</li><li>Keeps answers specific to <em>your</em> code instead of generic boilerplate.</li><li>Helps the AI reason about structure and dependencies instead of flailing.</li><li>Saves tokens, which means you save money.</li></ul><p>Your job is to do the Big Brain Thinking™ about the overall big picture and then give Cursor the context it needs in order to do the tedious grunt work.</p><hr><h2 id="how-cursor-handles-context" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-cursor-handles-context"><span>How Cursor Handles Context</span></a></h2><p>Cursor is not leaving you high-and-dry in this regard. It has some built-in smarts: it grabs the current file, recently viewed files, edit history, compiler errors, and even semantic search results. It will follow your dependency graph and get read the first little bit of every file in order to get a sense of what it does.</p><p>But the real control comes from explicit context management.</p><ul><li>@Files / @Folders – Point Cursor to exact code.</li><li>@Symbols – Zero in on a function, class, or hook.</li><li>@Docs – Pull in external documentation (yours or the framework’s).</li><li>@Web – Do a live web search mid-chat.</li><li>@Git – Bring in commit history or diffs.</li><li>@Linter Errors – Hand Cursor your error messages so it can fix them.</li><li>@Past Chats – Keep long conversations coherent.</li></ul><p>That’s just the tactical layer.

They’re extra important these days. For example, the better your tests are, the easier it is for Cursor to validate whether or not it successfully accomplished a task—and didn’t cause a regression in the process. It’s one thing to manually test your own code over and over, but it’s extra sobering to have to manually test code that you didn’t write. The better your Git etiquette is, the easier it will be to roll back to a known good state in the event that something goes off the rails.</p><ul><li><strong>Review before you merge.</strong> Always.
