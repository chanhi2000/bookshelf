However, risks shouldn’t discourage you from taking the right step. With a comprehensive cloud migration plan and professional guidance, you can smoothly move from on-premises infrastructure and achieve your business objectives in a new scalable environment. Below are the common cloud migration challenges to consider when developing a cloud migration strategy.</p><h3 id="data-security-and-privacy-vulnerabilities" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-security-and-privacy-vulnerabilities"><span>Data security and privacy vulnerabilities</span></a></h3><p>While cloud providers offer robust security measures, the shared responsibility model places a portion of the security burden on businesses. During migration, data can be exposed to potential vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. Issues such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and data leakage can arise if proper encryption and access controls are not in place.</p><p>Additionally, compliance with data protection regulations becomes more complex when data crosses geographical boundaries. To address this challenge, remember to apply stringent data security and privacy standards, thorough risk assessment, encryption protocols, regular security audits, and adherence to compliance regulations.</p><h3 id="data-integrity-and-transfer-errors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-integrity-and-transfer-errors"><span>Data integrity and transfer errors</span></a></h3><p>Moving large volumes of data is fraught with the risk of glitches, inaccuracies, and unforeseen errors. Inaccurate data mapping, network disruptions, and incompatible data formats can lead to partial or complete loss of critical information. Ensuring data integrity during the cloud migration process is essential. To avoid failures, focus on meticulous planning, robust backup strategies, thorough validation procedures, and regular testing and validation at each stage of the migration process. Such an approach will allow you to identify and correct potential errors before they can affect your business.</p><h3 id="performance-issues" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#performance-issues"><span>Performance issues</span></a></h3><p>Migrating to the cloud infrastructure can lead to unexpected bottlenecks, latency, and reduced application response times. Reconfiguration of systems and altering data pathways increase the potential for performance hitches that can negatively impact user experience and operational efficiency. To avoid trouble and address potential performance gaps, apply meticulous pre-migration testing, load balancing, and resource optimization. Keep an eye on performance after migration and be quick to address any issues to ensure scalability, responsiveness, and quality.</p><h3 id="budget-overruns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#budget-overruns"><span>Budget overruns</span></a></h3>',19)),t("p",null,[e[29]||(e[29]=o("Cost savings are a key advantage of cloud adoption.

Remember to include projected usage, data storage, network bandwidth, and any additional services. Also, make use of cloud pricing calculators and implement stringent budget controls to prevent unwelcome financial surprises.</p><h3 id="vendor-lock-in" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vendor-lock-in"><span>Vendor lock-in</span></a></h3><p>Vendor lock-in is a major concern when moving to the cloud. While moving to the cloud offers flexibility, reliance on proprietary tools and services from a specific cloud provider can limit future adaptability. As a result, companies may find themselves tied too tightly to a particular vendor’s ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to an alternative service, for example, a new cloud-based infrastructure, or transition back to on-premises solutions.</p><p>To avoid hassle and excessive costs, consider designing a cloud migration strategy under the guidance of an experienced partner. The optimal cloud model should allow for interoperability and portability across multiple cloud platforms. Employing standardized interfaces and open-source technologies can also help decrease the risk of vendor lock-in.</p><hr><h2 id="cloud-migration-strategies-gartner-s-5-rs-and-amazon-s-6-rs-models" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-migration-strategies-gartner-s-5-rs-and-amazon-s-6-rs-models"><span>Cloud migration strategies: Gartner’s 5 Rs and Amazon’s 6 Rs models</span></a></h2><p>In 2010, Gartner, a global research and advisory firm, published a 5 Rs framework for successful cloud migration. The model comprises five migration strategies that help businesses simplify the process and mitigate the risk related to moving their environment to the cloud. Building on Gartner’s outline, Amazon added its own perspective on the cloud migration strategy, further developing the original framework. The combined rules are as follows.</p><h3 id="rehosting-aka-lift-and-shift" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rehosting-aka-lift-and-shift"><span>Rehosting, aka lift and shift</span></a></h3><p>The rehosting strategy involves migrating applications and workloads to the cloud with minimal modifications. Rehosting aims to replicate the existing environment in the cloud without altering the application’s architecture or codebase. The lift and shift approach works well for companies seeking fast cloud migration options since it preserves existing investments, allows to avoid extensive redevelopment, and doesn’t affect security and compliance properties.</p><p>The downside of rehosting is the limited ability to leverage cloud-native capabilities for cost optimization and achieving business objectives in the long run. Other disadvantages include potential latency and performance issues or migration failure risk related to incorrect mapping of application requirements to cloud configuration.</p><h3 id="refactoring" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#refactoring"><span>Refactoring</span></a></h3><p>Refactoring focuses on optimizing existing applications for the cloud environment. This strategy involves rearchitecting the code so that the system fits in with cloud platform requirements. Refactoring allows you to take full advantage of cloud-native features, including more efficient resource use for cost optimization, which translates to long-term savings.</p><p>Rearchitecting is advised for businesses driven by a strong need to add new features, enhance performance, and rapidly scale - objectives hard to achieve in existing infrastructure. Refactoring allows organizations to modernize their applications and leverage the benefits of the cloud, providing them with increased resilience. The drawbacks include the time, skills, and costs it takes to perform the migration, as this model is much more demanding than mere rehosting.</p><h3 id="replatforming" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#replatforming"><span>Replatforming</span></a></h3><p>Replatforming is a cloud migration strategy that aims to strike a balance between swift transition and optimizing for cloud computing. This approach involves selective adjustments to applications, allowing them to take advantage of cloud-native services and features while retaining their fundamental functionalities. By optimizing code and architecture, businesses can enhance performance, scalability, and efficiency without undergoing a complete application overhaul.</p><p>Replatforming is a convenient option for companies interested in benefiting from the cloud environment without resorting to radical and potentially expensive strategies. Advantages include cost efficiency, low migration effort, and access to cloud features. The main downside is so-called scope creep - uncontrolled growth of work scope that may require adopting the refactoring approach.</p><h3 id="rebuilding-aka-recreating" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#rebuilding-aka-recreating"><span>Rebuilding aka recreating</span></a></h3><p>As the name suggests, the rebuilding cloud migration strategy includes rebuilding applications from scratch with cloud-native services, architectures, and best practices. Reimagining applications within the new environment may require scrapping most of the existing code. For this and other reasons, it is costly, but at the same time, it allows companies to create cloud-compliant systems and fully utilize the cloud’s benefits, such as scalability, flexibility, resilience, and agility, which may prove worthwhile in the long run.</p><p>The rebuilding strategy is the way to go for organizations aiming to pioneer new business models based on cutting-edge technologies. The key downside is investment costs. The big plus is a fresh start in a new environment without the technological debt.</p><h3 id="replacing-aka-retiring" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#replacing-aka-retiring"><span>Replacing aka retiring</span></a></h3><p>The replacing strategy involves phasing out an existing application. Retiring is an option when the system’s capabilities are no longer useful or provide insufficient business results. According to Amazon research, up to 20% of an enterprise IT portfolio can easily be turned off due to a lack of profitability. Retiring can yield significant savings that can be put to use for advancing cloud migration strategy. Instead of maintaining resource-intensive, outdated systems, businesses can focus on perfecting their cloud migration initiative and transitioning to a desired cloud infrastructure.</p><h3 id="retention" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#retention"><span>Retention</span></a></h3><p>The retention approach, Amazon’s input to the cloud migration strategies framework, essentially boils down to postponing migration and revisiting the priorities. The retention strategy doesn’t necessarily apply to the whole IT environment. It may include a portion of your portfolio if, for some reason, you’re not ready to move it to the cloud and prefer to keep it on-premises. The so-called hybrid or part migration strategy makes perfect sense if it is well-aligned with your business goals and fits into long-term planning.</p><hr><h2 id="golang-cloud-friendly-technology-from-google" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#golang-cloud-friendly-technology-from-google"><span>Golang: cloud-friendly technology from Google</span></a></h2>',25)),t("p",null,[e[32]||(e[32]=o("Inventing a good cloud migration strategy is never easy.
