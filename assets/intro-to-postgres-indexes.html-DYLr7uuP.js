Failing to do this can result in frustration when your database winds up not picking the index you want it to, for reasons that a good understanding could make clear.</p><hr><h2 id="indexes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#indexes"><span>Indexes</span></a></h2><p>The best way to think about a database index is in terms of an index in a book. These list all the major terms in the book, as well as all the pages that the term appears on. Imagine you have a 1,000 page book on the American Civil War, and wanted to know what pages Philip Sheridan are mentioned on. It would be excruciatingly slow to just look through all 1,000 pages, searching for those words. But if there’s a 30 or so page index, your task is considerably simpler.</p><p>Before we go further, let’s look at a very basic index over a numeric <code>id</code> column</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img4-index-1.png?resize=1024%2C290&amp;ssl=1" alt="A visual representation of a B Tree structure, showcasing internal nodes with key ranges and leaf nodes containing data values." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A visual representation of a B Tree structure, showcasing internal nodes with key ranges and leaf nodes containing data values.</figcaption></figure><p>This is a B Tree, which is how (most) indexes in a database are stored.</p><p>Start at the very, very bottom. Those blue “leaf” nodes contain the actual data in your index. These are the actual id values. This is a direct analogue to a book’s index.</p><p>So what are the gold boxes above them? These help you find <em>where</em> the leaf node is, with the value you’re looking for.</p><p>Let’s go to the very top, to the root node of our B Tree. Each of these internal nodes will have N key values, and N+1 pointers. If the value you’re looking for is strictly less than the first value, go down that first, left-most arrow and continue your search. If the value you’re looking for is greater than or equal to that first key, but strictly less than the next key, take the second arrow. And so on. In real life the number of keys in each of these nodes will be determined by how many of them can fit into a single page on disk (and will usually be much more than 3).</p><p>So with this B Tree, if we want to find id = 33, we start at the root. The id 33 is not &lt; 19, so we don’t take the first arrow. But 33 <em>is</em> &gt;=19 and &lt;37, so we take the middle arrow.</p><p>Now we repeat. The id 33 is not &lt; 25, so we don’t take the left most path. The id 33 is not &gt;= 25 <strong>AND</strong> &lt; 31, so we don’t take the middle path. But 33 <strong>is</strong> greater than 31 (it better be, this is the last path remaining), so we take the right most path. And that takes us to the leaf node with our key value.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/assets.codepen.io/3/btree-seek.gif?ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Notice also that these leaf nodes have pointers forward and backward. This allows us to not only find a <em>specific</em> key value, but also a <em>range</em> of values. If we wanted all ids &gt; 33, we could do as we did, and just keep reading.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/assets.codepen.io/3/btree-seek-read.gif?ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>But — now what? What if we ran a query of <code>SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = 33</code> – we’ve arrived at a leaf node in our index with … our key. How do we get all the <em>data</em> associated with that key? In other words the actual <em>row</em> in the database for that value?</p><p>The thing I’ve left off so far is that leaf nodes also contain pointers to the actual table where that value in question is.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/index-seek-with-heap-read-1.gif?resize=1024%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Returning briefly to our analogy with a book’s index, those heap pointers correspond to the page number beside each index entry, telling you where to go in the book to see the actual content.</p><p>So the full story to find a single row in our database by an id value, via an index, would actually look more like this:</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/assets.codepen.io/3/index-seek-with-heap-read.gif?ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>We’ll talk later about these heap reads, or lack thereof when we get into covering indexes and the Index Only Scan operation.</p><p>Bear with me a little longer. Before we look at what an index on title would look like, and create one in our database to run our query against, let’s take a slightly deeper look at B Trees. Internalizing how they work can be incredibly valuable.</p><h3 id="b-trees-run-in-o-logn-time" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#b-trees-run-in-o-logn-time"><span>B Trees run in O(LogN) time</span></a></h3><p>You may have been taught a fun little math fact in school, that if you were to be given a penny on January 1st, then have your penny doubled on January 2nd, then have that new amount (2 cents) doubled on January 3rd, etc, you’d have about $10 million dollars before February. That’s the power of exponential operations. Anytime you’re repeatedly multiplying a value by some constant (which is all doubling is, for constant 2), it will become enormous, <em>fast</em>.</p><p>Now think of a more depressing, reverse scenario. If someone gave you $10 million on January 1st, but with the condition that your remaining money would be halved each day, you’d have a lowly cent remaining on Feb 1st. This is a logarithm; it’s the inverse of exponentiation. Rather than <em>multiplying</em> a value by some constant, we <em>divide</em> it by some constant. No matter how enormous, it will become small, fast.</p><p>This is exactly how B Trees work. In our example B Tree above, there were 9 leaf pages. Our internal nodes had up to 3 pointers. Notice that we were able to find out the exact leaf node we wanted by following only 2 of those gold nodes’ arrows (which is also the <em>depth</em> of the tree).</p><p>9 divided by 3 is 3</p><p>3 divided by 3 is 1</p><p>Or, more succinctly, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub><mn>9</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\\log_{3}{9}=2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.9386em;vertical-align:-0.2441em;"></span><span class="mop"><span class="mop">lo<span style="margin-right:0.01389em;">g</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.207em;"><span style="top:-2.4559em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">3</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.2441em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">9</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span></p><p>Which reads as</p><div class="language-plaintext line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="plaintext"><pre><code class="language-plaintext"><span class="line">Logarithm base 3 of 9 is 2</span>

In this case, it knew that <em>relatively</em> few values would match on this filter, so it chose to use this index.</p><p>But that still doesn’t answer why it didn’t use a regular old index scan, following the various pointers to the heap. Here, Postgres decided that, even though the filter would exclude a large percentage of the table, it would need to read a <em>lot</em> of pages from the heap, and following all those <em>random</em> pointers from the index to the heap would be bad. Those pointers point in all manner of random directions, and <strong>Random I/O</strong> is bad. In fact, Postgres also stores just how closely, or badly those pointers correspond to the underlying order on the heap for that column via something called correlation. So if, somehow, the book entries in the heap just happened to be stored (more or less) in increasing values of pages, there would be a high correlation on the pages column, and this index would be more likely to be used for this query.</p><p>For these reasons, Postgres thought it would be better to use the index to <em>only</em> keep track of which heap locations had relevant records, and then fetch those heap locations in heap order, after the Bitmap scan sorted them. This results in neighboring chunks of memory in the heap being pulled together, rather than frequently following those random pointers from the index.</p><p>Again, Random I/O tends to be <em>expensive</em> and can hurt query performance. This was not faulty reasoning at all.</p><p>But in this case Postgres wagered wrong. Our query now runs <em>slower</em> than the regular table scan from before, on the same query. It now takes 1.38 seconds, instead of 833ms. Adding an index made this query run <em>slower</em>.</p><p>Was I forcing the issue with the larger limit of 100,000? Of course. My goal is to show how indexes work, how they can help, and occasionally, how they can lead the query optimizer to make the wrong choice, and hurt performance.
