Excellent for architectural planning and critical refactors, though slower and pricier.</li><li><strong>Claude 4.1 Opus</strong>: The newest version, with sharper reasoning and longer context windows.

Think GPT-4 but with significantly deeper reasoning, longer context, and a much better grasp of codebases at scale. It’s particularly strong at handling multi-file architectural changes and design discussions.

But when you want factual grounding or logic-intensive brainstorming, they’re hard to beat. GPT-5 in particular tends to go slower and check in more often. So, it’s a bit more of a hands-on experience than the Claude models. That said, given Claude’s tendency to go on side quests, I am not sure this is a bad thing. GPT-5 will often do the bare minimum but then come to you with suggestions for what it ought to do next and I find myself either agreeing or choosing a subset of its suggestions.</p></div><hr><h2 id="gemini-models-gemini-2-5-pro" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#gemini-models-gemini-2-5-pro"><span>Gemini Models (Gemini 2.5 Pro)</span></a></h2><p>Google’s Gemini slots in nicely for certain tasks: complex design, deep bug-hunting, and rapid completions. It’s more of a specialist tool—less universal than Claude or GPT, but very effective when you hit the right workload. Historically, one of the perks of Gemini is that it had a massive context window (around 2 million tokens). In the months since it was released, however, other models have caught up—namely Opus and GPT-5. Even Sonnet 4 now rocks a 1 million token context window.</p><p>I typically find myself using Gemini for research tasks. “Hey Gemini, look over my code base and come up with some suggestions for how I can make my tests less flaky and go write them to this file.” Its large context window makes it great for these kinds of tasks. It’s no slouch in your day-to-day coding tasks either. I just typically find myself reaching for something lighter—and cheaper.</p><hr><h2 id="deepseek-coder" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#deepseek-coder"><span>DeepSeek Coder</span></a></h2><p>Cursor also offers DeepSeek Coder, a leaner, cost-effective option hosted directly by Cursor. It’s good for troubleshooting and analysis, and useful if you want more privacy and predictable costs. That said, it doesn’t quite match the top-tier frontier models for heavy generative work.</p><hr><h2 id="local-models-llama2-derivatives-etc" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#local-models-llama2-derivatives-etc"><span>Local Models (LLaMa2 Derivatives, etc.)</span></a></h2><p>Sometimes you just need to keep everything on your own machine. Cursor supports local models, which are slower and less powerful but guarantee maximum privacy. These shine if you’re working with highly sensitive code or under strict compliance requirements. This is not my area of expertise. Mainly because my four-year-old MacBook can’t run these models at the same speed as one of OpenAI’s datacenters can.</p><hr><h2 id="model-selection-strategy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#model-selection-strategy"><span>Model Selection Strategy</span></a></h2><p>Here are some general heuristics I’ve found useful:</p><ul><li><strong>For small stuff</strong> (boilerplate, stubs, quick utilities): GPT-4o or a local model keeps things fast and cheap.</li><li><strong>For day-to-day coding</strong>: Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-4.1 are solid defaults. They balance reliability with performance. Gemini 2.5 Flash is also a strong contender in this department.</li><li><strong>For heavy lifting</strong> (large refactors, architecture, critical business logic): GPT-5 or Claude Opus 4.1 are the power tools. They’re not cheap, but often it costs less to get it right the first time. What I’ll typically do is have them write their plan to a Markdown file, review it, and then let a lighter weight model take over from there.</li><li><strong>When stuck</strong>: Swap models. If Claude hesitates, try GPT. If GPT spins in circles, Claude often cuts to the chase. This is not a super scientific approach, but it’s wildly effective—or at least it <em>feels</em> that way.</li><li><strong>Privacy first</strong>: Use local models or Cursor-hosted DeepSeek when your code should never leave your machine.

Reasoning‑forward models like OpenAI’s o3 and hybrid “thinking” models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet are pitched for deeper analysis; use them when you expect layered reasoning or ambiguous requirements.</p><p><strong>Behavior</strong>—Does it take initiative or wait for explicit instructions? Cursor’s model guide groups “thinking models” (e.g., o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro) versus “non‑thinking models” (e.g., Claude‑4‑Sonnet, GPT‑4.1) and spells out when each style helps. Assertive models are great for exploration and refactors; obedient models shine on surgical edits.</p><p><strong>Context</strong>—Do you need a lot of context right now? If you’re touching broad cross‑cutting concerns, enable Max Mode on models that support 1M‑token windows and observe whether plan quality improves enough to justify the slower, pricier runs. Having a bigger context window isn’t always a good thing. Regardless of what the model’s maximum context window size is, the more you load into that window, the longer it’s going to take to process all of those tokens. Generally speaking, having the <em>right</em> context is way better than having <em>more</em> context.</p><p><strong>Cost and reliability</strong>—Cursor bills at provider API rates; Auto exists to keep you moving when a provider hiccups. New models often carry different throughput/price curves—compare under your real workload, not just benchmarks. Cost is a tricky thing to evaluate because if a model costs more per token, but can accomplish the task in few tokens, it might end up being a bit cheaper when all is said and done.</p><p>Here is my pseudo-scientific guide for kicking the tires on a new model.</p><ol><li>Freeze variables. Use the same branch, same repo state, and the same prompt for each run. Turn Auto off when you’re pinning a candidate so you’re not measuring routing noise. Cursor’s guide confirms Auto isn’t task‑aware and excludes o3—so when you test o3 or any very new model, pin it.</li><li>Pick three task archetypes. Choose one surgical edit, one bug‑hunt, and one broader refactor. That trio exposes obedience, reasoning, and context behavior in a single pass. Cursor’s “modes” page clarifies that Agent can run commands and do multi‑file edits—ideal for these trials.</li><li>As Peter Drucker (or John Doerr, but I digress) used to say: Measure what matters. For each task and model, record: did tests pass; how much did it modify; did it follow constraints; how many agent tool calls and shell runs; and wall‑clock duration. Cursor’s headless CLI can stream structured events that include the chosen model and per‑request timing—perfect for quick logging.</li></ol><p>Repeat this process with Max Mode if the model you’re evaluating advertises giant context. You’re testing whether the larger window yields better plans or just slower ones.</p><hr><h2 id="wrapping-up" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wrapping-up"><span>Wrapping Up</span></a></h2><p>Model choice in Cursor isn’t just about “which AI is best”—it’s about matching the right tool to the task. Claude excels at simplifying and clarifying, GPT shines at reasoning and factual grounding, Gemini offers design chops, and local models guard your privacy.</p><p>And with GPT-5 and Opus 4.1 now in the mix, we’re entering a phase where models can reason about your codebase almost like a human teammate.
