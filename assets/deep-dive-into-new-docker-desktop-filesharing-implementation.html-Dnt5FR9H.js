The VFS is modular and supports many different filesystem implementations. In our case we use Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) which sends the request to a helper process running inside the VM labelled “FUSE client.” This process runs within the same namespace as the Docker engine. The FUSE client can handle some requests locally, but when it needs to access the host filesystem it connects to the host via “Hypervisor sockets.”</p><h3 id="hypervisor-sockets" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hypervisor-sockets"><span>Hypervisor Sockets</span></a></h3><p>Hypervisor sockets are a shared-memory communication mechanism which enables VMs to communicate with each other and with the host. Hypervisor sockets have a number of advantages over using regular virtual networking, including:</p><ol><li>since the traffic does not flow over a virtual ethernet/IP network, it is not affected by firewall policies</li><li>since the traffic is not routed like IP, it cannot be mis-routed by VPN clients</li><li>since the traffic uses shared memory, it can never leave the machine so we don’t have to worry about third parties intercepting it</li></ol><p>Docker Desktop already uses these sockets to forward the Docker API, to forward container ports, and now we use them for filesharing on Windows too!</p><p>Returning to the diagram, the FUSE client creates sockets using the AF_VSOCK address family, see step (3). The kernel contains a number of low-level transports, one per hypervisor. Since the underlying hypervisor is Hyper-V, we use the VMBus transport. In step (4) filesystem requests are written into the shared memory and read by the VMBus implementation in the Windows kernel. A FUSE server userspace process running in Windows reads the filesystem request over an AF_HYPERV socket in step (5).</p><h3 id="fuse-server" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fuse-server"><span>FUSE Server</span></a></h3><p>The request to open/close/read/write etc is received by the FUSE server, which is running as a regular Windows process. Finally in step (6) the FUSE server uses the Windows APIs to perform the read or write and then returns the result to the caller.</p><p>The FUSE server runs as the user who is running the Docker app, so it only has access to the user’s files and folders. There is no possibility of the VM gaining access to any other files, as could happen in the previous design if a local admin account is used to mount the drive in the VM.</p><h3 id="event-injection" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#event-injection"><span>Event Injection</span></a></h3><p>When files are modified in Linux, the kernel generates inotify events. Interested applications can watch for these events and take action.

Normally a Linux VFS implementation like FUSE wouldn’t generate the events itself; instead the common code in the higher layer generates events as a side-effect of performing actions. For example when the VFS “unlink” is called and returns successfully then the “unlink” event will be generated. So when the user calls “unlink” under Windows, how does Linux find out about it?</p><p>Docker Desktop watches for events on the host when the user runs <code>docker run -v</code>. When an “unlink” event is received on the host, a request to “please inject unlink” is forwarded over gRPC to the Linux VM. The following diagram shows the sequence of operations:</p><figure><img src="https://docker.com/app/uploads/2019/12/new_windows_filesharing_dd_02.png?fit=1110%2C954&amp;ssl=1" alt="new windows filesharing dd 02" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>new windows filesharing dd 02</figcaption></figure><p>A thread with a well-known pid inside the FUSE client in Linux “replays” the request by calling “unlink,” even though the directory has actually already been removed. The FUSE client intercepts requests from this well-known pid and pretends that the unlink hasn’t happened yet. For example, when FUSE_GETATTR is called, the FUSE client will say, “yes the directory is still here” (instead of ENOENT). When the FUSE_UNLINK is called, the FUSE client will say, “yes that worked” (instead of ENOENT). As a result of the successful FUSE_UNLINK the Linux kernel generates the inotify event.</p><hr><h2 id="caching" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caching"><span>Caching</span></a></h2><p>As you can see from the architecture diagram above, each I/O request has to make several user/kernel transitions and VM/host transitions to complete.
