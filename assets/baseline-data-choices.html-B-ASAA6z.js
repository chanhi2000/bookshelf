The Baseline widget doesn’t ever say <em>“it’s not supported, but there is a polyfill you could use!”</em>, which is something that might be very important information to have when deciding to use a feature. Again Rachel has insight:</p><blockquote><p>Initially, we considered a path that included polyfills. We thought it might be possible to have a less conservative version of Baseline that also included things with a solid polyfill. What became quickly apparent, however, was that very few features can be completely polyfilled so that you can just drop in the polyfill and use the feature as specified.</p></blockquote><p>In this case, I think I agree with the decision not to include any information about polyfills. In my experience there are precious few truly good polyfills, they <em>do</em> have a potential negative user impact, and they are a moving target.</p><p>I super appreciate the inside look into how decisions like these are come to!</p>",6)),t("p",null,[e[13]||(e[13]=o("What we need now is some UI somewhere that helps us figure out what the heck value to use as the ",-1)),e[14]||(e[14]=t("code",null,'featureId=""',-1)),e[15]||(e[15]=o(" in the ",-1)),t("a",D,[e[9]||(e[9]=t("code",null,"<baseline-status>",-1)),e[10]||(e[10]=o(" (",-1)),s(a,{icon:"iconfont icon-github"}),e[11]||(e[11]=t("code",null,"web-platform-dx/baseline-status",-1)),e[12]||(e[12]=o(")",-1))]),e[16]||(e[16]=o(" component.",-1))]),s(i,{name:"web-platform-dx/baseline-status",desc:"A Web Component widget displaying Baseline status of a web feature",url:"https://github.com/web-platform-dx/baseline-status/",logo:"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon-dark.svg",preview:"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/b965419e2a1fcc4764de5d492008550cd113ee8514f885d6f92c8ccb52cc7961/web-platform-dx/baseline-status"}),l(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),s(r,p(d({title:"Baseline Data Choices",desc:"Why can't we see if a feature is polyfillable or able to be progressively enhanced in the baseline data?
