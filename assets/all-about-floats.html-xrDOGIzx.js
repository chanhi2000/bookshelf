This is ideal as it requires no fancy hacks and no additional elements making it perfectly semantic. Of course things don’t typically work out that way and we need to have more float-clearing tools in our toolbox.</p><ul><li><strong>The Empty Div Method</strong> is, quite literally, an empty div. <code>&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> Sometimes you’ll see a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element or some other random element used, but div is the most common because it has no browser default styling, doesn’t have any special function, and is unlikely to be generically styled with CSS. This method is scorned by semantic purists since its presence has no contextual meaning at all to the page and is there purely for presentation. Of course in the strictest sense, they are right, but it gets the job done right and doesn’t hurt anybody.</li><li><strong>The Overflow Method</strong> relies on setting the overflow CSS property on a parent element. If this property is set to auto or hidden on the parent element, the parent will expand to contain the floats, effectively clearing it for succeeding elements. This method can be beautifully semantic as it may not require additional elements. However if you find yourself adding a new div just to apply this, it is equally as non-semantic as the empty div method and less adaptable. Also bear in mind that the overflow property isn’t specifically for clearing floats. Be careful not to hide content or trigger unwanted scrollbars.</li><li><strong>The Easy Clearing Method</strong> uses a clever CSS pseudo selector (<code>:after</code>) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class like “clearfix” to it. Then apply this CSS:</li></ul><div class="language-css line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="css"><pre><code class="language-css"><span class="line"><span class="token selector">.clearfix:after</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> </span>
