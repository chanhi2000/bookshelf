If someone was to for example impersonate the website you think you are communicating with, you would certainly get notified by your browser.</p><p>That would not prevent malicious attackers to steal your credentials if they have a legitimate domain with a legitimate certificate.

For example, when you browse twitter.com you can see:</p><figure><img src="'+z+'" alt="Twitter EV certificate" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Twitter EV certificate</figcaption></figure><p>That means they are using EV certificate to prove that their company stands behind that website.</p><h3 id="certificate-chains" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#certificate-chains"><span>Certificate Chains</span></a></h3><p>So why would your browser trust the certificate that server sends back? Any server can send a piece of digital documentation and claim it is what you want it to be.</p><p>That’s where root certificates come in. Typically certificates are chained and the root certificate is one your machine implicitly trusts.</p><p>For my blog it looks like this:</p><figure><img src="'+C+'" alt="certificate chain" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>certificate chain</figcaption></figure><p>Lowest one is my domain certificate, which is signed by the certificate above it and so on… Until the root certificate is reached.</p><p>But who signs the root certificate you might wonder?</p><p>Well, it signs itself 😀</p><figure><img src="'+I+'" alt="certificate info" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>certificate info</figcaption></figure><p>Issued to: AddTrust External CA Root, Issued by: AddTrust External CA Root.</p><p>And your machine and your browsers have a list of trusted root certificates which they rely upon to ensure the domain you are browsing is trusted. If the certificate chain is broken for some reason (happened to me because I enabled CDN for my blog), your site will be displayed as insecure on some machines.</p><p>You can check the list of trusted root certificates on Windows by running the certificate manager by pressing the windows button + R and typing certmgr.msc. You can then find machine trusted certificates in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities section. This list is used by Windows, IE, and Chrome.
