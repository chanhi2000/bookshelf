This prevented the animation from morphing into the next shape. It immediately snapped to the next image without animating the transition, skipping ahead to the next shape (both when going into the cylinder and coming out of it).</p><p>I went back into Affinity Designer and ever-so-slightly added curvature to the two lines, and then it morphed perfectly.

So, I’m setting the animation’s timing function with <code>ease-in-out</code>. Unfortunately, this will also slow down the rotation as it starts and ends. However, because we’re both beginning and ending with the circle shape, the fact that the rotation slows coming out of 0% and slows again as it heads into 100% is not noticeable — a circle looks like a circle no matter its rotation. If we were ending with a different shape, the easing would be visible and I would use two separate sets of keyframes — one for the shape-shift and one for the rotation — and call them both on the <code>#geminianimation</code> child <code>div</code> .</p><div class="language-css line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="css"><pre><code class="language-css"><span class="line"><span class="token selector">#geminianimation:hover</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>
