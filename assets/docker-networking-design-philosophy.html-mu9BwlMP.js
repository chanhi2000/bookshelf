This also means developers have more freedom in how exactly the application topology is defined.</p><hr><h2 id="users-network-it" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#users-network-it"><span>Users: Network IT</span></a></h2><p>While the application developer wants to be free of infrastructure details and wants a portable application deployment experience, the network IT team wants to make sure all applications deployed in the infrastructure run smoothly and complies with the application’s SLAs and business rules. This means the ability to change network configurations and even providers without disrupting the application’s functionality and intent. Agile means speed for developers and a different kind of speed for network IT, the kind where they are able to respond quickly to changing needs and make adjustments without breaking something else.</p><p>The “how” part of the equation is accomplished with a “driver” abstraction. Given a definition of an abstract network topology, how that topology is achieved in concrete terms depends on the driver that is used. By defining the Docker Networking plugin API that every driver can easily conform to, one can simply deploy the exact same application-driven network topology in any infrastructure by replacing one driver with another.</p><p>The plugin API provides a hook to the driver when:</p><ul><li>a network is created</li><li>a container is connected to a network</li><li>a container needs an IP address</li></ul><p>These are the most essential hooks to achieve network connectivity for any application network topology. Docker provides the same network connectivity guarantees to the application regardless of the driver used. At the same time, the network IT team is free to choose any driver which facilitates the application topologies in their infrastructure.</p><p>There are some special kinds of drivers called “plugins”. All plugins are drivers. But plugins are not built into the Docker Engine binary. They are independent external programs (in most cases, they are docker containers themselves) that use the same driver API as the built-in drivers. So in essence one can swap out a built-in driver for an external plugin to achieve any network topology. This reflects Docker’s philosophy of “Batteries included but swappable”. Plugins are critical in supporting portability and choice for network IT.</p><p>When we first started thinking about enhancing Docker Networking it was clear that plugins should be a first class citizen. In any infrastructure the connectivity and discoverability needs of applications are wide and varied. There is no single solution for that problem that will satisfy every user and application. Therefore plugins have been an important part of Docker Networking design from the very beginning. We decided that when we release the first version of new Docker Networking the ability to “swap the battery” was available to the users. In the end that is exactly how we released Docker Networking in Docker 1.9. ### Plugin API Design</p><p>While application network topology and network abstraction is more focused on the application developer, the driver/plugin configuration is focused on IT administrators. Network IT is more focused on the infrastructure and related service levels on which the application is going to be deployed. However, they do want to ensure that they can meet the application’s network connectivity intent.</p><p>They want to ensure that:</p><ul><li>the right solution to plumb the networking path is used</li><li>the right solution to manage networking resources is used</li><li>the right solution to discover application services is used</li><li>they can make separate and independent choices on all of the above</li></ul><p>Providing the flexibility to network IT to pick and choose various solutions for the various elements of network configuration gives the best operations experience.</p><p>Instead of providing one all-encompassing plugin API/extension-point, we segmented the plugin API into separate extension points corresponding to logical configuration groupings:</p>',15)),n("ul",null,[n("li",null,[e[28]||(e[28]=s("The ")),n("a",P,[e[25]||(e[25]=s("network driver extension point (")),a(t,{icon:"iconfont icon-github"}),e[26]||(e[26]=n("code",null,"docker/go-plugins-helpers",-1)),e[27]||(e[27]=s(")"))]),e[29]||(e[29]=s(" provides the API needed to configure and achieve network connectivity"))]),n("li",null,[e[33]||(e[33]=s("The ")),n("a",A,[e[30]||(e[30]=s("IPAM extension point (")),a(t,{icon:"iconfont icon-github"}),e[31]||(e[31]=n("code",null,"docker/go-plugins-helpers",-1)),e[32]||(e[32]=s(")"))]),e[34]||(e[34]=s(" to configure, discover and manage IP address ranges"))])]),e[61]||(e[61]=n("p",null,"The design gets its inspiration from the golang interface philosophy, which advocates defining one “interface” per function to encourage composability.

For example two different drivers may want to plumb a static route with the same route prefix but with a different next hop IP. When this happens it is simply not possible for these drivers to independently choose whose route wins without sacrificing the user experience. Therefore, as part of the plugin API libnetwork doesn’t provide driver’s access to the container’s network namespace since there is no way a particular driver will be able to resolve these conflicts by itself.

The UI and API are designed in a way that network IT can configure the infrastructure with as little coordination with the application developers as possible. It avoids the lock-stepped workflow between the application developers and Network IT team.</p><p>For example, if the application developer requests that network IT just create networks with certain names, then the network IT can go independently and start creating those networks applying configuration options that are appropriate for the given infrastructure. At the same time, the application developer can work on composing the application assuming that those networks with the referenced names will be available to achieve the network topology that the application needs.</p><p>With that in mind the branch in UI and API roughly looks as follows:</p><ul><li>Network IT can create, administer and precisely control which network driver and IPAM driver combination is used for the network. They can also specify various network specific configurations like subnets, gateway, IP ranges etc. and also pass on driver specific configuration, if any.</li><li>A configuration is to connect any container to the created network. This one has application developer focus since their concern is mainly one of connectivity and discoverability.</li></ul><p>A typical way an application developer can compose the application is using a “Docker Compose” file where one can specify all the application services which are part of the application and how they connect to each other in an application defined topology referencing networks which may be pre-provisioned by the network IT.</p><p>In fact, the developer builds an application using Docker Compose file which inherently defines the application topology. The exact same compose file can now be used to deploy the application in any infrastructure and the network IT team could pre-provision the network (that is referenced in the Compose file) based on the infrastructure requirements. The key aspect of it is that the application developer does not need to revisit the Compose file every time it is deployed to a different environment.</p><p>This separation of concern enables a workflow where developers and network IT can work independently in provisioning networks and deploying applications, using different plugins if needed.</p><p>As an example, let’s consider the following Compose v2 application:</p><div class="code-block-with-title"><div class="code-block-title-bar" data-title="docker-compose.yml"><span>docker-compose.yml</span></div><div class="language-yaml line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="yml"><pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="line"><span class="token key atrule">version</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">&quot;2&quot;</span></span>

So, as stated in the beginning we wanted to hide as many networking artifacts as possible, one last thing that needed hiding is the IP addresses themselves. IP addresses expose something about the underlying infrastructure and this reduces the portability experience for the application. If applications can discover each other using names that they know at compile time, then it completes the portability story. This is exactly what we achieved by providing implicit container discovery using embedded DNS server. The container “linking” and “aliasing” capabilities, ensures that containers can discover their peer containers with the name they knew at the compile time.</p><hr>`,10)),v(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),a(p,c(d({title:"Docker Networking Design PhilosophyDocker",desc:"Learn from Docker experts to simplify and advance your app development and management with Docker.
