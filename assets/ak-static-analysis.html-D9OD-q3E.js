Some of these patterns require years of experience to be fully mastered. After all, you don&#39;t expect a junior Kotlin engineer to write an annotation processor.</p><p>Discovering recurring patterns and applying them has always been a problem in the field of computer science.</p><p>That&#39;s why engineers who work on programming language tools, such as compilers, have also developed tools to help engineers identify recurrent patterns: these are called <strong>static analysers</strong>. While you&#39;re already taking a step toward mastering these patterns by reading this book, having a tool that automatically discovers and applies them will take you to the next level.</p><p>For example, several of the patterns that are described in the “Effective Kotlin” book can be automated with the help of static analysers.</p><p>However, the real power of static analysers lies in the fact that they can be customized, therefore you can discover and enforce your <strong>own</strong> patterns. When working on bigger codebases with hundreds of contributors, you can&#39;t really rely only on code reviews. It&#39;s crucial to have tools that automate and help you bring consensus and arbitrate conflict between developers. That&#39;s why static analysers are tools that should never be missing in the advanced Kotlin developer&#39;s toolbox.</p><p>In this chapter, we&#39;ll walk through the basics of static analysis, and we&#39;ll learn how to use one of the most popular static analysers for Kotlin: <strong>detekt</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id="what-are-static-analysers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-static-analysers"><span>What are Static Analysers?</span></a></h2><p>As the name suggests, static analysers are tools that spot bugs and recurrent patterns by analysing your code statically, i.e., without running it[^12].</p><p>Running your code is generally considered an expensive operation. Think about Kotlin/JVM, where you need to start a Java Virtual Machine, or Android, where you need an emulator or a physical device to run your code. One technique that can be used to protect your code from bugs is writing tests! They&#39;re a great tool to prevent bugs from reaching production, but they require a runtime and are an expensive operation that becomes more and more expensive as your codebase grows.</p><p>On the other hand, static analysers look at your code without executing it at all, so there is no need to start a runtime environment at all.</p><p>For example, there is no need to execute your code to warn you that you’ve declared a variable that you&#39;re not using. A static analyser can keep track of all the variables you’ve declared and those you access. The ones you declare but never access are most likely[^0] unused and can be removed.</p><p>Static analysers can leverage language-specific properties to determine the correctness of your code. For instance, the Kotlin type system can be used to infer types and use type information to do further analysis, similarly to how the Kotlin compiler does. Let&#39;s take a look at this simple example:</p><div class="language-kotlin line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="kt"><pre><code class="language-kotlin"><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">fun</span> <span class="token function">getTheAnswer</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>answer<span class="token operator">:</span> String <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string-literal singleline"><span class="token string">&quot;24&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">:</span> String <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

You could write a unit test for it and confirm that the result is as expected, but we could immediately spot a couple of potential problems just by looking at it: as the type of <code>answer</code> is a non-nullable <code>String</code>, there is no need to use either the <code>?.</code> (safe call) or the <code>!!</code> (not-null assert) operator. Instead, the return expression can be simplified to just <code>return answer.reversed()</code>[^13].</p><p>A static analyser can help you with this and other types of inspection, which could be helpful to enforce a style guide across your codebase (e.g., all unnecessary usages of <code>import</code> should be removed). Other types could help prevent potential bugs ending up in your codebase (e.g., when an expression’s return value is ignored and never used).</p><p>Static analysers are often referred to as &#39;linters&#39;, a term which comes from &#39;lint&#39;, the first static analyser for C, developed in the 70s[^1]. Lint itself takes its name from the tiny bits of fabric that appear on your clothes as you wear them. A linter should inspect your codebase and capture all these small imperfections and potential problems.</p><figure><img src="https://kt.academy/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcinmoskala.com%2Fadvanced-kotlin-book%2Fmanuscript%2Fresources%2F13_real_world_linter.jpg&amp;w=576&amp;q=75" alt="A real-world linter.

I like to think of static analysers and code reviews as complementary, but there is a difference: the former help you spot and automate a lot of recurring coding issues, while the latter are crucial to ensure high code quality and share responsibility for shipped changes. Unfortunately, static analysers can&#39;t currently fully understand a developer’s intent. You could potentially ship malicious code or “beautifully broken code” that is fully compliant with static analysers as it passes all the checks.</p><p>Perhaps, in a not too distant future, advanced AI models could power static analysers to fully automate the code review process. At the time of writing, this is not the case, so code reviews are still considered a fundamental process and are widely adopted in the IT sector.</p><p>In academia, static analysers are a vast subject of study and research. Researchers have developed numerous techniques to formally verify that code satisfies requirements and behaves as expected. Formally verifying code behavior can be business-critical in various sectors (think about software in the medical or aerospace industries).</p><p>It&#39;s outside the scope of this chapter to present all the formal methods of inspecting and verifying your code, but you can find plenty of literature on this. However, to better understand the tools available in the Kotlin ecosystem, we&#39;ll walk through some of the various types of static analysers for Kotlin.</p><hr><h2 id="types-of-analysers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-analysers"><span>Types of analysers</span></a></h2><p>It&#39;s hard to make a neat division in the ecosystem of static analysers, as you&#39;ll find a plethora of tools doing all sorts of inspection and automation.

Generally, they operate on a tree-like representation of your code called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).</p><p>With an Abstract Syntax Tree, analysers can inspect specific nodes of the tree to perform inspections. Static analysers generally use the visitor pattern to register inspection on specific nodes of an AST.</p><p>Say, for example, you want to prevent usage of the <code>println</code> function in your codebase as you have a dedicated logger and want to ensure all logging goes through it.</p><p>Your inspector can ask to visit all the nodes in your AST that are of type “function call”. On these nodes, the inspector will report a finding whenever the caller function is <code>println</code>[^4].</p><p>The amount of information available in an AST might vary depending on different tools and the type of inspection that you&#39;re interested in doing.

Similarly, in a potential <code>else</code> branch or after the <code>if</code>, the set of possible values would be restricted to just <code>null</code>.</p><p>Data-flow analysers use the rules of the relevant programming language to compute the set of possible values of your identifier at each statement. With this information, you can perform more advanced analysis. For instance, you can inform the users of types that are too broad and can be restricted (e.g., an analyser could tell you to use <code>List</code> instead of <code>Collection</code> if the set of values is restricted to <code>List</code> only).</p><p>Kotlin uses data-flow analysis inside the compiler[^5] to power some of its popular features, such as smart-casting.</p><p>Most code quality analysers in the industry also do data-flow analysis but are just marketed as “static analysers”.

For example, if an analyser discovers an unused variable, the manipulation would be to entirely remove the line where this variable is declared.</p><p>However, this is often considered an invasive operation as analysers generally need to perform substantial modification to make code conform to their rules. Sometimes, removing a line or an annotation is sufficient; other times, there are multiple solutions to a violation but the analyser can&#39;t pick one without a human decision. On top of this, newly created code could raise other violations or might be improperly formatted.</p><p>For this reason, static analysers tend to not manipulate code automatically; instead, they raise a violation warning and suggest one or more alternatives to resolve it.</p><h3 id="embedded-vs-standalone" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#embedded-vs-standalone"><span>Embedded vs Standalone</span></a></h3><p>Finally, it is worth noting that some static analysers are embedded in tools we use daily, while others are distributed as standalone software.</p><p>For instance, the Kotlin Compiler has a static analyser built-in that raises warnings while it compiles code. IntelliJ IDEA also has a built-in static analyser which offers inspections as you type, with code suggestions in the contextual menu.</p><p>On the other hand, tools like detekt, ktlint, and others are standalone. You can typically execute them from the command line by specifying your source files. These standalone static analysers offer plugins and integrations for the most popular developer environments (IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, Visual Studio Code and so on).

It offers inspections which are Android specific, so it can inspect not only Java and Kotlin files, but also Gradle files and XML files (and other Android-related files). Android Lint is integrated inside Android Studio and it&#39;s probably the best pick for developers looking to integrate static analysis in their Android projects. The Android Studio integration allows Android Lint to also act as a code manipulator by offering <em>quick fixes</em>: small tooltips on top of the inspection that allow the user to selectively apply the suggested changes. Android Lint is also extensible with custom detectors and can be executed via Gradle or as a standalone tool, without needing to have Android Studio installed.</p><h3 id="detekt" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#detekt"><span>detekt</span></a></h3><p><a href="https://detekt.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detekt</a> is a standalone static-analyser for Kotlin. Unlike Android Lint, it&#39;s general purpose and focuses only on Kotlin code. It can&#39;t inspect Java code, but it&#39;s easier to integrate in any Kotlin project.</p><p>detekt is community developed and, at the time of writing, offers more than 300 inspections. It primarily offers a Gradle plugin and a Kotlin Compiler plugin to integrate with existing projects. Moreover, detekt can be integrated with IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, Bazel and much more.</p><p>One key feature of detekt is its extensibility, which makes it easier to write custom rules to achieve your desired inspections.

We start by extending an external class provided by detekt: our rule is a class called <code>MyRule</code>, which extends detekt&#39;s <code>Rule</code> class. The <code>Config</code> parameter we pass to the constructor is what we can use to access the configuration file.</p><p><code>Rule</code> is actually an abstract class and requires us to implement the <code>issue</code> property, which is a representation of the issue this rule is currently reporting; it contains the error message and information about the severity of the issue. Each rule can report one or more of these issues.</p><p>detekt performs code quality analysis and allows the Abstract Syntax Tree to be visited by overriding one of the various <code>visit*</code> methods. In the template, we implement the <code>visitClass</code> method that will allow each <code>class</code> declaration to be inspected.</p><p>As our rule is designed to inspect expressions, we need to implement the <code>visitDotQualifiedExpression</code> instead[^9]. To implement our rule, we&#39;ll have to implement the method as follows:</p><div class="code-block-with-title"><div class="code-block-title-bar" data-title="MyRule.kt"><span>MyRule.kt</span></div><div class="language-kotlin line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="kt"><pre><code class="language-kotlin"><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token function">MyRule</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>config<span class="token operator">:</span> Config<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token function">Rule</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>config<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

It&#39;s a good start and will cover most use cases, but a more precise way to perform these inspections would be to have a richer Abstract Syntax Tree which has type information. The current implementation does not ensure that the <code>System.out.println</code> you&#39;re invoking comes from the <code>java.lang</code> package and not from another <code>System</code> class the user created in their project.</p><p>To have access to richer Abstract Syntax trees, we would need to use a more advanced type of rule. These rules rely not on a single file but on the compile-time information for the entire project so that they can retrieve type information computed by the Kotlin compiler for every declaration and identifier. It&#39;s outside the scope of this book to deep dive into compiler topics or the PSI API as these are quite extensive and would probably require their own book to cover in detail.</p><p>You can find plenty of examples of more advanced rules in the detekt codebase, which can be used as a source of inspiration for your custom rules.</p><hr><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>In this chapter, we’ve discovered what static analysers are and which types of analyses they can perform.
