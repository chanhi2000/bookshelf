We would gain efficiency in that there may not need be much translation at all between design and the finished product. Time and quality suffer during the translation required now.</p><p>We could look at all the different things tried to bridge this gap. There are many — all of varying interest. I believe it is safe to say that none of them have “won”. Tools that replicate the features of the web faithfully have trouble with complexity and finding an audience that wants that. Even the prevailing web design tool today, Figma, runs <em>on</em> the web but the designs you create there are not really <em>of</em> the web. You’re drawing rectangles on a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> there, not crafting <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s. And while some of those abstractions in Figma are designed to <em>replicate</em> web features, they are that: a replication, not reality.</p><p>But instead of looking at takes on design tool abstraction, I’d rather enumerate many of the things that make design tools that replicate the web difficult.</p><p>Staring, naturally, with this most basic of web design concepts.</p><hr><h2 id="link-button-states" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#link-button-states"><span>Link &amp; Button States</span></a></h2><p>Most sites have a style for links and buttons, and design software has no problem accommodating that. But those styles change in different states. What happens when you hover them? Click them? Tab to focus them? Those can (and should) have different designs, but static design software doesn’t always accommodate that very well, leaving you to invent your own system for how to represent it.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/states.png?resize=734%2C377&amp;ssl=1" alt="I don’t find  states particularity common, likely because design software doesn’t care to prompt you into state-based design." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>I don’t find <code>:active</code> states particularity common, likely because design software doesn’t care to prompt you into state-based design.</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="color-modes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#color-modes"><span>Color Modes</span></a></h2><p>Speaking of state, you could think of light/dark mode as a state for the entire design of the website.</p><p>Looking at the button designs above, if you put a very dark background instead of the light tan, those dark brown button borders will not be very visible if at all. It’s a designer’s job to consider that, plan for that, and design for that. Can/should/does your design software help with that?</p><p>Color modes are complicated anyway, as the choice of a color mode can be set as low-level as the operating system the browser is running on, the browser may change the mode, the browser may offer site-specific color mode settings, and the site itself may offer code mode settings of it’s own. And perhaps more than just light and dark!</p><p>Not to mention accessibility considerations. There has been experimental features like browsers than can force sites into certain color modes, and long-standing accessibility features like High Contrast mode on Windows.

Does your design software have a way of specifying variables? Then setting state in various places that change the values of those variables? I can answer that for you: it probably doesn’t. Even if it has a <em>concept</em> of variables, it’s likely abstracted in a way that doesn’t work quite like the web does. The key difficulty being that CSS custom properties cascade through the DOM and can be set/adjusted at any level.

Maybe at really wide widths it could go up to more columns? How flexible are those column widths? Do they have a min and max? Should we be thinking about how paragraphs break across them? What if an image or other media goes into the columns, should it behave in any special way?</p><p>What about the font sizing in the example above? The biggest bit of text definitely changes size, but how? Fluidly? Set sizes at set breakpoints? Does <em>all</em> type do that or just some? How can we <em>design</em> that?</p><p>There is so much to think about with fluid, responsive design. Design tools I feel barely scratch the surface, and it’s been a good decade-and-a-half here.
