What are crop marks? They were pretty damn important in my print design and digital prepress days. Designers would hang parts of the design <em>off the edge of the document</em> and the expectation is that the ink literally goes to the edge of the paper when printed. Printers can’t actually print to the edge of the paper though (it would be messy!) so instead, the use a <em>little bit bigger paper</em>, <strong>crop marks</strong> are added, and the design is printed a bit outside the crop marks. Then the final piece is literally <em>cut</em> at those marks, making the design hit the edges as intended.</p><p>Design software like InDesign can output files destined for printing this way with these marks.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CleanShot-2026-01-12-at-16.06.35%402x.png?resize=1024%2C531&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot of Adobe InDesign 2026 interface showing export settings for PDF, including options for printer&#39;s marks like crop marks, bleed marks, registration marks, and color bars." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Screenshot of Adobe InDesign 2026 interface showing export settings for PDF, including options for printer&#39;s marks like crop marks, bleed marks, registration marks, and color bars.</figcaption></figure><p>Then the PDF will be a bit bigger than the designed sheet size and have these marks:</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CleanShot-2026-01-12-at-16.07.41%402x.png?resize=1024%2C695&amp;ssl=1" alt="A screenshot of a PDF document showing crop marks in the corner and a large pink shape filling the page." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A screenshot of a PDF document showing crop marks in the corner and a large pink shape filling the page.</figcaption></figure><p>Imagine thousands of printed pages like this all stacked up.
