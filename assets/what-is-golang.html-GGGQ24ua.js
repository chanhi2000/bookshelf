As it was built just 13 years ago, it’s natural that it would be better adapted to modern times and technology. A great example of that is included support for multicore CPUs, whose share in the market was rapidly growing and for obvious reasons was missed in predecessors. This directly translates into easier development of apps using multi-threads and makes them more reliable.</p><p>Thanks to years of experience in the market it was also designed as a fast and versatile language, easier to learn, with syntax more accessible and easier scalable for bigger projects.
