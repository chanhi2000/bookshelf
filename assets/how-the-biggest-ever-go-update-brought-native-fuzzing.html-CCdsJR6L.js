Go creators felt that none of the other programming languages could concurrently offer the level of efficiency in compiler instrumentation, execution, and general ease of programming. With these criteria in mind, Golang developers started designing a language that would soon become one of the most developer-friendly languages.</p><p>Although Google created Go much later than some of the other popular languages, its developers could take into consideration modern trends such as cloud computing into consideration while designing the language itself.</p><p>Simplicity, great performance, user-friendly compiler, and easy deployment - code is compiled to a single binary, so there’s no hassle with multiple binary files. Add low resource usage and a standard library with a decent networking package and you have an excellent contender for the developer’s choice.</p><p>Golang can be treated as the language of modern applications. To not look too far, there’s Kubernetes, one of the major containerization platforms written completely in Go</p><hr><h2 id="go-1-18-what-came-with-this-major-programming-language-update" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#go-1-18-what-came-with-this-major-programming-language-update"><span>Go 1.18 - what came with this major programming language update?</span></a></h2><p>As the Go dev blog states, Go 1.18 introduced significant “changes to the language, implementation of the core toolchain, runtime, and libraries”. And what changes do we talk about exactly?</p><p>For one, Generics were introduced. This was the support for generic programming in Go that some users really wanted. The generic code is written with abstract data types that were called type parameters.</p><p>Other introduced features and bug fixes included quite numerous changes to the go command, vet update for generic code, runtime (garbage collector changes), and fuzz testing.</p><hr><h2 id="fuzz-testing-in-go" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fuzz-testing-in-go"><span>Fuzz testing in Go</span></a></h2><p>Go 1.18 introduced Go fuzz tests (or fuzzing) which is a type of automated testing that manipulates inputs to a program in order to find bugs. In fact, Go was either the first major programming language to introduce fuzz testing as support for fuzz tests for other major languages such as Python or Java is practically non-existent. Though the “unsafe” no longer maintained languages support fuzzing (e.g. C++) mostly to expose bugs and find potential security exploits, it is usually done with third-party support integrations and not native support.</p><p>Go fuzz testing code coverage guidance to walk through the code in an intelligent way and report on A failing input to the user. Due to its generative nature, it can often uncover edge-case bugs that a human would normally miss. A fuzz test is often a good way to find potential security issues and program vulnerabilities.</p><p>Now there are certain requirements when it comes to Go test fuzz. For one a fuzz test must be a function that accepts only <code>*testing.F</code> and has no return value, a fuzz target must be a method call to <code>(*testing.F).Fuzz</code> which accepts <code>*testing.T</code> as the first parameter and is followed by the fuzzing argument. Moreover, the number of fuzz targets must be exactly one per fuzz test and the fuzz test arguments can only be of certain types.</p><p>Before starting a test fuzz please mind that it can consume a lot of memory to the point of impacting the performance of your machine while it’s conducting fuzz tests. The fuzzing engine also writes values that grow the fuzz cache directory while it runs. Moreover, there is no limit to the number of files in the fuzz cache so big storage might be needed.</p><hr><h2 id="running-fuzz-tests-in-go" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#running-fuzz-tests-in-go"><span>Running fuzz tests in Go</span></a></h2><p>You can run fuzzing in two ways. First, as a unit test with the default <code>go test</code>. Second, with fuzzing with <code>go test -fuzz=TestName</code>. In general, fuzz tests are run similarly to the unit tests - every seed corpus file will be tested against the fuzz target. All failures will be then reported before exiting the given corpus entry.</p><p>Here’s an example output:</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh"><pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="line">go <span class="token builtin class-name">test</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-fuzz</span> Fuzzy</span>
