Here are some strategies to make sure your site responds quickly:</p><ul><li><strong>Yield to the Main Thread</strong>: Avoid monopolizing the main thread with long-running tasks. When you block the main thread, user interactions get stuck waiting. Breaking up heavy tasks with<code>setTimeout</code>or<code>requestAnimationFrame</code>can reduce delays and keep the main thread open for user input.</li><li><strong>Optimize JavaScript</strong>: Large JavaScript bundles are often the main culprit for interaction delays. Reduce bundle size through code-splitting, lazy-loading, and minifying to improve response times. Only load what&#39;s necessary at each stage of the user journey.</li><li><strong>Reduce Long Animation Frames (LoAF)</strong>: A poor INP score often coincides with Long Animation Frames, so addressing LoAF can directly improve INP. This includes avoiding intensive calculations during animations and syncing visuals with the browser&#39;s rendering cycle.</li></ul><p>Implementing these strategies can bring down your INP score, keeping interactions responsive and making your site feel faster and more polished.</p><h3 id="example-inp-fix" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-inp-fix"><span>Example INP Fix</span></a></h3>',6)),t("p",null,[e[15]||(e[15]=n("Let's have a look at a specific example.
