We developed and donated a majority of the OCI code and have been instrumental in defining the OCI runtime and image specifications as maintainers of the project. When the Docker runtime and image format quickly became the de facto standards after being released as open source in 2013, we thought it would be beneficial to donate the code to a neutral governance body to avoid fragmentation and encourage innovation. The goal was to provide a dependable and standardized specification so Docker contributed runc, a simple container runtime, as the basis of the runtime specification work, and later contributed the Docker V2 image specification as the basis for the OCI image specification work.</p><p>Docker developers like Michael Crosby and Stephen Day have been key contributors from the beginning of this work, ensuring Docker’s experience hosting and running billions of container images carries through to the OCI. When the certification working group completes its work, Docker will bring its products through the OCI certification process to demonstrate OCI conformance.</p><hr><h2 id="myth-the-oci-specifications-are-about-linux-containers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#myth-the-oci-specifications-are-about-linux-containers"><span>Myth: The OCI specifications are about Linux containers</span></a></h2><p>There is a misperception that the OCI is only applicable to Linux container technologies because it is under the aegis of the Linux Foundation. The reality is that although Docker technology started in the Linux world, Docker has been collaborating with Microsoft to bring our container technology, platform and tooling to the world of Windows Server. Additionally, the underlying technology that Docker has donated to the OCI is broadly applicable to multi-architecture environments including Linux, Windows and Solaris and covers x86, ARM and IBM zSeries.</p><hr><h2 id="myth-docker-was-just-one-of-many-contributors-to-the-oci" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#myth-docker-was-just-one-of-many-contributors-to-the-oci"><span>Myth: Docker was just one of many contributors to the OCI</span></a></h2><p>The OCI as an organization has a lot of supporting members representing the breadth of the container industry. That said, it has been a small but dedicated group of individual technologists that have contributed the time and technology to the efforts that have produced the initial specifications. Docker was a founding member of the OCI, contributing the initial code base that would form the basis of the runtime specification and later the reference implementation itself. Likewise, Docker contributed the Docker V2 Image specification to act as the basis of the OCI image specification.</p><hr><h2 id="myth-cri-o-is-an-oci-project" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#myth-cri-o-is-an-oci-project"><span>Myth: CRI-O is an OCI project</span></a></h2><p>CRI-O is an open source project in the Kubernetes incubator in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) - it is not an OCI project. It is based on an earlier version of the Docker architecture, whereas containerd is a direct CNCF project that is a larger container runtime that includes the runc reference implementation. containerd is responsible for image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, and low-level functions to support storage and network attachments. Docker donated containerd to the CNCF with the support of the five largest cloud providers: Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Softlayer and Microsoft Azure with a charter of being a core container runtime for multiple container platforms and orchestration systems.</p><hr><h2 id="myth-the-oci-specifications-are-now-complete" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#myth-the-oci-specifications-are-now-complete"><span>Myth: The OCI specifications are now complete</span></a></h2><p>While the release of the runtime and image format specifications is an important milestone, there’s still work to be done. The initial scope of the OCI was to define a narrow specification on which developers could depend for the runtime behavior of a container, preventing fragmentation in the industry, and still allowing innovation in the evolving container domain. This was later expanded to include a container image specification.</p><p>As the working groups complete the first stable specifications for runtime behavior and image format, new work is under consideration. Ideas for future work include distribution and signing. The next most important work for the OCI, however, is delivering on a certification process backed by a test suite now that the first specifications are stable.</p>',17)),g(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),i(s,p(l({title:"Demystifying the Open Container Initiative (OCI) Specifications",desc:"Learn from Docker experts to simplify and advance your app development and management with Docker.
