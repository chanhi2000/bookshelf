Maybe not the definitive answer you were looking for.</p><p>But you probably are not surprised. If you have been working in web development even a short amount of time, you know that there are very few definitive ways of doing things. There are a lot of different approaches, and just because someone else solves it differently, does not mean you are right and they are wrong (or vice versa). Most things come down to the project you are working on, your audience, and a host of other factors.</p><p>For my personal site, yes, I would like to un-Sass. I want to kick the build process to the curb and eliminate those dependencies. I would also like for other developers to be able to view source on my CSS. You can’t view source on Sass. And part of the reason I write on my site is to share solutions that might benefit others, and making code more accessible is a nice maintenance enhancement.</p><p>My personal site does not have a very large codebase. I could probably easily un-Sass it in a couple of days or over a weekend.</p><p>But for larger sites, like the codebase I work with at my job. I wouldn’t suggest un-Sassing it. There is way too much code that would have to be refactored and I am unable to justify the cost for that kind of effort. And honestly, it is not something I feel motivated to tackle. It works just fine the way that it is. And Sass is still a very good tool to use. It’s not “breaking” anything.</p><p>Your project may be different and there might be more gains from un-Sassing than the project I work on. Again, it depends.</p><hr><h2 id="the-way-forward" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-way-forward"><span>The way forward</span></a></h2><p>It is an exciting time to be a CSS developer.

And it might not mean doing a complete overhaul. A lot of newer techniques can live side by side with the older ones. We have a mix of both Sass variables and CSS custom properties in our codebase.
