Instead of specifying <code>1.2.3.4</code> as our GELF target, we will use <code>gelf.container.church</code>, and make sure that this points to 1.2.3.4. That way, whenever we need to send messages to a different machine, we just update the DNS record, and our Docker Engine happily sends the messages to the new machine.</p><p>Or does it?</p><p>If you have to write some code sending data to a remote machine (say, gelf.container.church on port 12345), the simplest version will look like this:</p><ol><li>Resolve <code>gelf.container.church</code> to an IP address (A.B.C.D).</li><li>Create a socket.</li><li>Connect this socket to A.B.C.D, on port 12345.</li><li>Send data on the socket.</li></ol><p>If you must send data multiple times, you will keep the socket open, both for convenience and efficiency purposes. This is particularly important with TCP sockets, because before sending your data, you have to go through the “3-way handshake” to establish the TCP connection; in other words, the 3rd step in our list above is very expensive (compared to the cost of sending a small packet of data).</p><p>In the case of UDP sockets, you might be tempted to think: “Ah, since I don’t need to do the 3-way handshake before sending data (the 3rd step in our list above is essentially free), I can go through all 4 steps each time I need to send a message!” But in fact, if you do that, you will quickly realize that you are now stumped by the first step, the DNS resolution. DNS resolution is less expensive than a TCP 3-way handshake, but barely: it still requires a round-trip to your DNS resolver.</p><p>Aparté: yes, it is possible to have very efficient local DNS resolvers. Something like pdns-recursor or dnsmasq running on <code>localhost</code> will get you some craaazy fast DNS response time for cached queries. However, if you need to make a DNS request each time you need to send a log message, it will add an indirect, but significant, cost to your application, since every log line will generate not only one syscall, but three. Damned! And some people (like, almost everyone running on EC2) are using their cloud provider’s DNS service. These people will incur two extra network packets for each log line. And when the cloud provider’s DNS is down, logging will be broken. Not cool.</p><p>Conclusion: if you log over UDP, you don’t want to resolve the logging server address each time you send a message.</p><hr><h2 id="hmmm-tcp-to-the-rescue-then" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hmmm-tcp-to-the-rescue-then"><span>Hmmm … TCP to the rescue, then?</span></a></h2><p>It would make sense to use a TCP connection, and keep it up as long as we need it. If anything horrible happens to the logging server, we can trust the TCP state machine to detect it eventually (because timeouts and whatnots) and notify us.
