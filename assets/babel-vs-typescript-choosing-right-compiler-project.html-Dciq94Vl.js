Understanding how the TypeScript compiler works and the compilation process is essential for TypeScript developers to produce efficient and error-free JavaScript code.</p><p>Here’s an overview of the compilation process:</p><ul><li><strong>TypeScript code input</strong>: The TypeScript compiler takes TypeScript source code files (<code>.ts</code>) as input. These files contain TypeScript-specific syntax, including static typing annotations, interfaces, classes, and other TypeScript language features</li><li><strong>Lexical analysis (scanning)</strong>: The first step in the compilation process is lexical analysis, also known as scanning. The TypeScript compiler scans the input source code and breaks it down into individual tokens (such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators) through a process called tokenization</li><li><strong>Syntax analysis (parsing)</strong>: After tokenization, the TypeScript compiler performs syntax analysis, also known as parsing. It uses the generated tokens to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the hierarchical structure of the TypeScript code</li><li><strong>Semantic analysis (type checking)</strong>: Once the AST is created, the TypeScript compiler proceeds to the semantic analysis phase, which involves type-checking. During this stage, the compiler examines the types of variables, expressions, and other elements in the code based on the provided type annotations and inferred types</li><li><strong>Transformation and emitting JavaScript</strong>: After successful type checking, the TypeScript compiler goes through a transformation phase, where it applies various transformations, optimizations, and transpilations to the AST. The TypeScript compiler may perform operations like removing TypeScript-specific syntax (e.g., type annotations), converting advanced TypeScript features (e.g., decorators), or transpiling new ECMAScript features (e.g., <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>) into older JavaScript constructs for compatibility with different browsers and environments. The final output of the transformation phase is a new AST representing plain JavaScript code, without any TypeScript-specific constructs</li><li><strong>Generating output (JavaScript files)</strong>: The transformed AST is used to generate JavaScript code files (.js) corresponding to the original TypeScript source files. The TypeScript compiler creates the corresponding <code>.js</code> files with the transpiled JavaScript code</li><li><strong>Declaration files (<code>.d.ts</code>)</strong>: Additionally, the TypeScript compiler may also generate declaration files (.d.ts) during the compilation process. Declaration files provide type information for external libraries or JavaScript modules, allowing TypeScript developers to use them seamlessly within their TypeScript projects.</li><li><strong>Emitting output</strong>: Finally, the TypeScript compiler emits the generated JavaScript files (.js) and declaration files (<code>.d.ts</code>) as output. These files are now ready to be executed by browsers or Node.js</li></ul><hr><h2 id="babel-s-role-in-typescript-integration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#babel-s-role-in-typescript-integration"><span>Babel’s role in TypeScript integration</span></a></h2><p>Babel plays a significant role in integrating TypeScript into JavaScript projects and workflows. While TypeScript provides static typing and advanced language features, Babel complements it by enabling transpilation of TypeScript code into widely supported versions of JavaScript.</p><p>Here’s how Babel contributes to the integration of TypeScript:</p><h3 id="transpilation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#transpilation"><span>Transpilation</span></a></h3><p>TypeScript introduces features that may not be natively supported in older browsers or specific environments. Babel acts as a transpiler, taking TypeScript code (with static typing, decorators, etc.) and converting it into equivalent JavaScript code.</p><p>The transpilation process ensures that the TypeScript features are transformed into syntax and constructs compatible with the target environment.</p><h3 id="compatibility-with-build-tools" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compatibility-with-build-tools"><span>Compatibility with build tools</span></a></h3><p>Many modern JavaScript projects use build tools like webpack, Rollup, or Parcel to bundle and optimize code. Babel integrates seamlessly with these build tools, allowing TypeScript code to be transpiled and included in the project’s build process.</p><p>Developers can leverage Babel plugins to fine-tune the transpilation process, making it compatible with the specific needs and requirements of the project.</p><h3 id="easing-migration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#easing-migration"><span>Easing migration</span></a></h3><p>Babel helps in the gradual migration of existing JavaScript projects to TypeScript. By setting up Babel to transpile TypeScript code, developers can introduce TypeScript incrementally to their projects without rewriting the entire codebase at once. This allows developers to benefit from TypeScript’s type checking and other language features in specific parts of the project as they transition to TypeScript.</p><h3 id="react-and-jsx-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#react-and-jsx-support"><span>React and JSX support</span></a></h3><p>Babel is commonly used in React.js development to support JSX syntax, which is not natively understood by browsers. JSX allows developers to write React components more intuitively.</p><p>When using TypeScript with React, Babel ensures that the JSX syntax in TypeScript files is properly transpiled, allowing developers to write JSX components in a TypeScript environment.</p><h3 id="customization-with-plugins" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#customization-with-plugins"><span>Customization with plugins</span></a></h3><p>Babel’s extensive plugin ecosystem allows developers to add custom plugins and presets that cater to specific TypeScript use cases. Developers can choose from a range of plugins to support experimental TypeScript proposals, implement custom transformations, and fine-tune the transpilation process.</p><h3 id="support-for-experimental-typescript-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#support-for-experimental-typescript-features"><span>Support for experimental TypeScript features:</span></a></h3><p>Babel often supports TypeScript features that are still in the proposal stage or not yet standardized by ECMAScript.

It enables developers to use the latest ECMAScript features while maintaining compatibility with older browsers or environments that lack support for those features. Polyfills help bridge this gap by providing the missing functionality.</p><h3 id="babel-s-auto-polyfill" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#babel-s-auto-polyfill"><span>Babel’s auto polyfill</span></a></h3><p>Babel provides an automatic polyfilling mechanism through the <code>@babel/preset-env</code> preset. When you configure Babel with <code>@babel/preset-env</code>, it automatically detects the ECMAScript features used in your code and includes the necessary polyfills only for the features that are missing in the target environment.</p><p>For example, if you use a modern ES6 feature like <code>Promise</code> in your code and the target environment lacks support for it, Babel’s auto polyfill will include a minimal and optimized polyfill for <code>Promise</code> in the output code. This approach ensures that your code runs correctly in older browsers that lack native <code>Promise</code> support.</p><p>The advantage of auto polyfilling is that it reduces the size of the output bundle by only including necessary polyfills, making the application more efficient.</p><h3 id="typescript-s-approach-to-polyfilling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#typescript-s-approach-to-polyfilling"><span>TypeScript’s approach to polyfilling</span></a></h3>',33)),t("p",null,[e[31]||(e[31]=o("TypeScript itself does not provide built-in polyfilling like Babel.
