Reviews, summaries, fan theories, whatever. Seems like that would be distracting ‚Äî but I think it‚Äôs extra engaging sometimes. I‚Äôd often end up on Wikipedia where they do episode informational summaries in a particular layout where the small screen layout had a horribly obnoxious side effect.</p><p>Here (was) the issue:</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CleanShot-2024-12-05-at-11.26.07%402x.png?resize=573%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>To their credit, they made the data table responsive in that it‚Äôs not zoomed out or cut off, you can horizontally scroll it. But horizontal scrolling is super terrible when you‚Äôre trying to read a paragraph of text.</p><p>Also to their credit, they‚Äôve also (recently?) made this a bit better.</p><p>They put a wrapper element over the show description and added <code>max-width: 90vw;</code> to the styles. It was kinda funny though, as I happen to notice that and I was looking at a page where that was <em>still a smidge too wide</em> and it was cutting off like 50px of text so there was still a bit of horizontal scrolling needed.</p><p>The problem is that <code>90vw</code> is a <strong>‚Äúmagic number‚Äù</strong>. It‚Äôs essentially saying ‚Äúpretty close to the width of the screen, but like, not all of it, because there is some padding and stuff the account for.‚Äù It‚Äôs just a guess. I get it, sometimes you gotta just be close and move on, but here I‚Äôve literally seen it fail, which is the whole downside of magic numbers.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-05-at-11.33.40‚ÄØAM-1.png?resize=837%2C1024&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If they were trying to be perfect about it, that <code>max-width</code> would be set to account for all the other spacing. Something like:</p><div class="language-css line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="css"><pre><code class="language-css"><span class="line"><span class="token selector">.shortSummaryText</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

This kind of thing can be hard to maintain so I get it.</p><p>Notice in the screenshot above they also added <code>position: sticky;</code> and stuck it to the <code>left</code> side, which is a super classy touch! That way when the table is scrolled to see the other bits of information in a row, the readable paragraphs stay readable, rather than scroll over into just blank white nothingness.</p>`,12)),t("p",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=n("I did a fork of the classic ")),t("a",k,[a(c,{icon:"fas fa-globe"}),e[0]||(e[0]=n("Under-Engineered Responsive Tables"))]),e[2]||(e[2]=n(" to include this feature."))]),a(d,{user:"chriscoyier","slug-hash":"EaYPbGE",title:"Under-Engineered Responsive Table (with paragraph width alteration)","default-tab":["css","result"],theme:o.$isDarkmode?"dark":"light"},null,8,["theme"]),u(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),a(r,i(l({title:"Responsive Tables & Readable Paragraphs",desc:"You can make a table responsive by letting it horizontally scroll.
