As time continues and other ecosystems such as npm continue to host huge numbers of packages, JavaScript will only continue increasing in popularity.</p><p>But what‚Äôs done is done. No matter how weird it is that <code>null</code> is an <code>object</code>, or that JavaScript will pop semicolons in where it sees fit, these systems will probably never be deprecated, changed, or removed. Anecdotally, I would say that if Automatic Semicolon Injection was turned off overnight, it‚Äôd probably cause a bigger global outage than the CrowdStrike update would.</p><p>Certainly, changing one of these would wreak havoc on the web. It‚Äôs actually safer, and probably more practical, to make the developers aware of these particular language quirks than to actually go back and resolve the original problems.</p><p>So, go and make good choices, and don‚Äôt forget to use semicolons!</p>',55)),y(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),n(c,l(u({title:"Six things you may not know about JavaScript",desc:"Learn about semicolon injection, array
