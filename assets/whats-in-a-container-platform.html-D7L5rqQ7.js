At a high level, one of the goals of modernization – the leading reason organizations are adopting container platforms – is to rid ourselves of technical debt. Organizations want the freedom to create their apps based on the “right” stack and running in the “right” place, even though what’s “right” may vary from app to app. So the container platform running those applications should be flexible and open to support those needs, rather than rigidly tying application teams to a single OS or virtualization and cloud model.</p><hr><h2 id="high-velocity-innovation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#high-velocity-innovation"><span>High-Velocity Innovation</span></a></h2><p>To deliver high velocity innovation your developers are a key constituent for the container platform.

That means making complex tasks simpler from day one with the assurance that the platform will work as expected, while still allowing them to grow their skills over time.

With the push for more frequent and faster software releases, security has to be part of both the developer’s experience and the operator’s experience.

You should have guardrails that help developers get started quickly from known good foundations, shifting left in your security process instead of finding out later that something is broken. And your platform should give you visibility into every application you ship: Windows or Linux, Edge or data centers.
