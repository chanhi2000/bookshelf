Again Rachel has insight:</p><blockquote><p>Initially, we considered a path that included polyfills. We thought it might be possible to have a less conservative version of Baseline that also included things with a solid polyfill. What became quickly apparent, however, was that very few features can be completely polyfilled so that you can just drop in the polyfill and use the feature as specified.</p></blockquote><p>In this case, I think I agree with the decision not to include any information about polyfills.
