It has nothing to do with what those bricks should look like. A heading is a heading, a paragraph is a paragraph, and a button is another kind of brick. The browser follows my instructions for adding the bricks I want to the house.</p><p>Trying to explain that to her forced me to slow down. I found myself describing HTML as the vocabulary of the page: it gives names to each piece so the browser can build the document tree behind the scenes. Then the tree becomes the foundation that CSS and JavaScript can later rely on. Without those names, the browser would not know where the different elements should relate to one other. Already, I was finding it tough to describe HTML without getting into the other core languages.</p><p>I paused, watching her reaction, and was reminded something. Every polished writing begins as a bare idea and then transforms into an outline — just like a polished interface begins with an outline.

The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> is sort of like the “roof” of the house and the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> like the bottom floor.</p><p>I explained to her that those elements behave more like rooms and doorways than decoration.
