We&#39;re told they&#39;re legacy, that they don&#39;t scale, and that we need microservices to succeed. After spending many years scaling systems from startups to enterprises, I can tell you this isn&#39;t true. A well-designed monolith is often the right architecture choice, and it can scale remarkably well with the right approach.</p><p>In my experience building and scaling monolithic systems, I&#39;ve found that the key to success isn&#39;t following trends. It&#39;s understanding your scaling needs and applying the right solutions at the right time. In this article, I&#39;ll share what I&#39;ve learned about scaling monoliths effectively and when to use each approach.</p><hr><h2 id="understanding-scale" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-scale"><span>Understanding Scale</span></a></h2><p>A monolith puts all your code in one deployable unit. This brings significant advantages: faster development cycles, simpler debugging, and straightforward deployments. But as your system grows, you&#39;ll face scaling challenges.</p><figure><img src="https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_125/monolith_system.png?imwidth=384" alt="Simple monolith system." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Simple monolith system.</figcaption></figure><p>Your database queries slow down as data volume grows.

These are natural growing pains that every successful system faces.</p><hr><h2 id="vertical-scaling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vertical-scaling"><span>Vertical Scaling</span></a></h2><p>Vertical scaling means giving your application more resources on a single machine. It&#39;s the simplest scaling strategy and often the most effective first step. Before diving into complex distributed systems, consider whether upgrading your existing infrastructure could solve your performance problems.</p><figure><img src="https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_125/vertical_scaling.png?imwidth=1920" alt="Example of vertically scaling a monolith." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Example of vertically scaling a monolith.</figcaption></figure><p>Vertical scaling works particularly well when there are clear resource bottlenecks. If your CPU is consistently above 80% utilization, adding more cores will help. If your database is I/O bound, upgrading to faster storage can dramatically improve performance. Modern cloud platforms make this especially straightforward. You can often upgrade with a few clicks and minimal downtime.</p><p>The benefits of vertical scaling extend beyond just performance. It maintains your system&#39;s simplicity. You don&#39;t need to redesign your architecture, implement new deployment patterns, or manage distributed system complexity. Your monitoring, debugging, and operational procedures all stay the same.</p><p>However, vertical scaling does have limits. You&#39;ll eventually hit a ceiling on what a single machine can handle. Cloud providers have maximum instance sizes, and costs typically increase exponentially with larger instances. More importantly, vertical scaling doesn&#39;t provide redundancy - you&#39;re still running on a single machine that represents a potential single point of failure.</p><p>Knowing when to move beyond vertical scaling is crucial. Watch for these indicators:</p><ul><li>Costs are growing faster than your user base</li><li>You need better redundancy and fault tolerance</li><li>Your deployment downtime is impacting business operations</li><li>Your largest available instance size is approaching 70% utilization</li></ul><hr><h2 id="horizontal-scaling" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#horizontal-scaling"><span>Horizontal Scaling</span></a></h2>',18)),a("p",null,[i(l,{to:"/milanjovanovic.tech/horizontally-scaling-aspnetcore-apis-with-yarp-load-balancing.html"},{default:n(()=>[...e[10]||(e[10]=[a("strong",null,"Horizontal scaling",-1)])]),_:1}),e[11]||(e[11]=t(" runs multiple instances of your application behind a load balancer.

Let&#39;s explore each scaling strategy in detail.</p><h3 id="read-replicas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#read-replicas"><span>Read Replicas</span></a></h3><p>Read replicas are often your first step in database scaling but come with significant trade-offs. Read replicas maintain a copy of your primary database that serves read-only traffic. When you run a query against a replica, you&#39;re not competing with writes on your primary database.</p><p>Each replica maintains an up-to-date copy of your data through replication. Changes flow one-way: from primary to replicas. This means any data written to your primary will eventually show up in your replicas. That &quot;eventually&quot; is important - you&#39;re trading consistency for better read performance.</p><p>Most cloud providers make read replicas easy to set up. AWS RDS and Azure SQL all support read replicas with minimal configuration. They handle replication, monitoring, and failover for you.</p><figure><img src="https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_125/database_read_replicas.png?imwidth=3840" alt="Example of database read replication for scaling a monolith." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Example of database read replication for scaling a monolith.</figcaption></figure><div class="hint-container important"><p class="hint-container-title">When implementing read replicas, consider:</p><ul><li>Replication lag affects data freshness</li><li>Write volume impacts replication speed</li><li>Geographic location affects latency</li><li>Each replica adds to your costs</li></ul></div><h3 id="materialized-views" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#materialized-views"><span>Materialized Views</span></a></h3><p>Sometimes read replicas aren&#39;t enough. Perhaps you need to reshape your data for specific use cases, or you&#39;re running complex analytical queries that are slow even on a replica. This is where materialized views come in.</p><p>A materialized view is a pre-computed dataset stored as a table. Unlike regular views that compute their results on each query, materialized views store their results. This makes them much faster to query but introduces a new challenge: keeping them up to date.</p><div class="hint-container important"><p class="hint-container-title">Materialized views excel at:</p><ul><li>Complex analytical queries</li><li>Data that updates on a schedule</li><li>Aggregations and summaries</li><li>Denormalized data for specific views</li></ul></div><p>The key trade-off is freshness versus performance. You need to decide how often to refresh your materialized views. Too often, and you&#39;re putting load on your database. Too rarely, and your data gets stale.</p><h3 id="database-sharding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#database-sharding"><span>Database Sharding</span></a></h3><p>Sharding becomes necessary when your database grows beyond what a single instance can handle. Sharding splits your data across multiple database instances, with each shard containing a distinct subset of your data. The key to successful sharding lies in choosing the right sharding strategy for your use case.</p><h4 id="range-based-sharding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#range-based-sharding"><span>Range-based sharding</span></a></h4><p>splits data based on ranges of a key value - for example, customers A-M go to Shard 1, N-Z to Shard 2. This approach works well with data that has a natural range distribution, like dates or alphabetical order, but can lead to hotspots if certain ranges see more activity than others.</p><h4 id="hash-based-sharding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hash-based-sharding"><span>Hash-based sharding</span></a></h4><p>applies a hash function to your sharding key to determine which shard holds the data. The choice of hashing function is crucial. It must distribute data evenly across your shards to prevent any single shard from becoming a bottleneck. While this approach provides better data distribution, it makes range-based queries more complex since related data might live on different shards.</p><h4 id="tenant-based-sharding" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tenant-based-sharding"><span>Tenant-based sharding</span></a></h4><p>gives each tenant their own database. This approach provides natural isolation and makes tenant-specific operations straightforward.

They let you defer time-consuming operations and distribute work across multiple processors. This keeps your API responsive while handling heavy tasks in the background.</p><p>Message queues transform your system&#39;s behavior under load. Instead of processing everything synchronously, you can queue work for later. This pattern works especially well for operations like:</p><ul><li>Processing uploaded files</li><li>Sending emails and notifications</li><li>Generating reports</li><li>Updating search indexes</li><li>Running batch operations</li></ul><p>The real power of message queues lies in their ability to handle traffic spikes.
