Web development, machine learning, AI</span></a></h2><p>As a general-purpose language, Python is one of the “hidden forces” in today’s internet, lurking in websites, gaming software, business apps, web servers, AI algorithms, data science tools, and more. It is used in many fields and in many ways. Python fully supports object-oriented and structured programming, with some of its features and extensions supporting functional, aspect-oriented, logic, and other types of programming.</p><p>The language offers a comprehensive standard library but was designed to be extensible via modules. In three decades of its existence, the technology has yielded an impressive number of libraries and powerful frameworks that speed up the development process. As of September 2022, the Python Package Index (a repository of software for the Python programming language) contains over 400 thousand packages for all sorts of applications, including communications, data analytics, desktop environment, games, home automation, multimedia, security, and many more.</p><p>With the scope of applications enabled by Python and its modules, pointing to a few areas of focus might seem arbitrary. However, there are domains where Python excels.</p><h3 id="web-development" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#web-development"><span>Web development</span></a></h3><p>Python is a common choice for web development, primarily due to relevant frameworks like Django and Pyramid and microframeworks like Flask and Bottle. Typically, Python is used for dealing with the backend. A less-known fact is that it also works as a front-end language. In May 2022, project Anaconda introduced PyScript, a framework enabling users to create Python programs with an HTML interface.</p><h3 id="artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning"><span>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</span></a></h3><p>Python is considered among the top programming languages for AI and ML development. Due to the simplicity and learnability of its syntax, it enables developers to deal faster with complex algorithms and big data. Python provides excellent libraries for AI/ML and deep learning applications, such as Keras, NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or Theano. It’s also worth noting that most AI frameworks provide direct support for Python.</p><h3 id="data-science-and-data-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-science-and-data-visualization"><span>Data science and data visualization</span></a></h3><p>Python is widely used in the research area for scientific and business purposes.

It was designed with scalability and reliability in mind to deal with the hurdles posed by the growing cloud infrastructure at Google. Its makers, frustrated with the overcomplicated nature of C++, wanted to create an efficient programming language for managing large-scale projects. They combined Python’s simplicity, Javascript’s abundance of useful features, and C’s disciplined syntax to concoct a much improved and easier-to-use successor to C++.</p><p>Thanks to its unique features and thriving community, Golang has become a vital component of the modern cloud computing environment and one of the most effective technologies for large-scale infrastructure. It’s extensively used for system programming and developing server-side applications. It has also proved its efficiency in solving data science problems and creating AI algorithms.</p><p>Let’s name a few areas where Go’s strengths shine.</p><h3 id="distributed-networked-services" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-networked-services"><span>Distributed networked services</span></a></h3><p>Go has a neatly designed standard library for common tasks with built-in functions for network programming. It natively supports concurrency (allowing multiple tasks to progress simultaneously) and parallelism (allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously), which makes it a perfect tool for creating highly networked and concurrent software. Go is naturally suited for developing web servers, REST applications, or mini frameworks for web apps.</p><h3 id="scalable-cloud-computing-systems" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scalable-cloud-computing-systems"><span>Scalable cloud computing systems</span></a></h3><p>Owing to its speed and rich support for managing concurrency with goroutines and channels, Golang is an excellent language for developing efficient cloud-native software and microservices.

Python is used on a much wider scale, while Golang is more niche. There are domains where both these languages overlap. However, Python’s scope of use is still greater than Golang’s, and so is the number of Python libraries and frameworks, Python-related learning resources, and community support. This divergence results from the age discrepancy of both programming languages but also reflects their structural and functional differences.</p><p>Python is a dynamically typed language. The interpreter doesn’t know the variables’ types “beforehand,” as they are determined only during runtime. Such a feature increases the ease of coding but slows down code execution. On the other hand, Go is a statically typed language, but it has a dynamic-like quality thanks to a small syntactic overhead. It’s worth mentioning that both Python and Golang are strongly typed: they enforce strong restrictions on typing to prevent implicit conversions between unrelated types.</p><p>One of Go’s main strengths is its native parallelism and concurrency support, and it beats Python in this regard. The latter also offers tools for managing these features, but they’re not included in the standard library. Go is widely recognized for handling both types of computation more efficiently.</p><p>A noteworthy difference is Python’s support for inheritance and Golang’s lack thereof. Inheritance increases code reusability and simplifies development, though it might decrease the execution speed - the quality at which Golang excels.</p><p>Regarding the core strengths of both languages and putting them to practical use, Go is perfect for systems programming and developing cloud systems, while Python works best for solving data science problems and developing machine learning applications.</p><p>There is plenty of other characteristics that distinguish both programming languages, such as the use of indentation. For practical reasons though, let’s skip less substantial technicalities and move on to naming key advantages and disadvantages of both Python and Golang.</p><hr><h2 id="python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#python"><span>Python</span></a></h2>',47)),t(c,{data:[{id:"Advantages"},{id:"Disadventages"}],active:0},{title0:n(({value:s,isActive:r})=>[...a[23]||(a[23]=[o("Advantages",-1)])]),title1:n(({value:s,isActive:r})=>[...a[24]||(a[24]=[o("Disadventages",-1)])]),tab0:n(({value:s,isActive:r})=>[...a[25]||(a[25]=[e("p",null,[e("strong",null,"It has simple, English-like syntax")],-1),e("p",null,"This great feature translates to ease of writing Python code and speeding up the development process.
