Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.<br> Martin Fowler</p></blockquote></div><p>Automating your build, test, and deploy processes can alleviate much of the headaches and problems commonly happening on projects. Having a reliable method of integrating changes more frequently ensures that errors can be found sooner than later. Having a blocking issue that appeared right on the demo day as the result of some part of the code you implemented a few months earlier and haven’t had a proper chance to test against other parts of your system is not a pleasant event at all.</p><p>We can all agree that having a blocking issue that appeared right in the demo is not a pleasant experience. CI can help with that. A lot.</p><figure><img src="'+I+'" alt="Here is how the basic CI lifecycle looks like." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Here is how the basic CI lifecycle looks like.</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="benefits-of-using-continuous-integration" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits-of-using-continuous-integration"><span>Benefits of Using Continuous Integration</span></a></h2><p>Using the CI is beneficial for many reasons.</p><h3 id="reduced-integration-risk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reduced-integration-risk"><span>Reduced integration risk</span></a></h3><p>More often than not, working on projects means multiple people are working on separate tasks or parts of the code.

If you want to install CI server in your own environment, you’ll need a few things first.</p><p>The first requirement is having the <strong>version control system (VCS)</strong>. There is no way around it and there shouldn’t be a way around it. VCS provides a reliable method to centralize and preserve changes made to your project over time.</p><p>If you are using onsite solutions another requirement is to have a spare server or workstation or at the very least a virtual machine. Having a clean machine to build your system on is of essential importance.</p><p>If you don’t want to mess with either servers or virtual machines, there are many hosted CI tool solutions that abstract the maintenance of the whole process and offer easier scalability. The disadvantages of the hosted systems are usually the lack of configuration options that self-hosted tools offer.</p><p>If you opt-in for the self-hosted variant, you will need to install one of the many available continuous integration tools.</p><p>Technically, the CI tool is not required per se, like the IDE is not required for software development but it would be significantly harder to implement Continuous Integration without the help of one.</p>',34)),t("p",null,[e[24]||(e[24]=o("The most widely known and used CI tools include Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, Go… Read more about the ",-1)),n(l,{to:"/code-maze.com/top-8-continuous-integration-tools.html"},{default:a(()=>[...e[23]||(e[23]=[t("strong",null,"top CI tools available",-1)])]),_:1}),e[25]||(e[25]=o(".",-1))]),e[34]||(e[34]=u('<hr><h2 id="continuous-integration-servers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-integration-servers"><span>Continuous Integration Servers</span></a></h2><p>Continuous integration server (aka build server, aka CI server) is a software tool that centralizes all your CI operations and provides a reliable and stable environment for you to build your projects on. CI servers are highly configurable and adjustable to be able to build a variety of projects for different platforms. Running builds and tests are the basic features of every build server.</p><p>The most important thing to consider when using a CI server is to have a clean machine prepared for its installation. Having a neutral environment, untainted by unnecessary tools, environment variables, and other configurations, is crucial for the successful usage of the CI server and CI overall. If it’s not possible to install the CI server <strong>physical machine</strong>, you can set up a <strong>virtual environment</strong> and use it as the last resort.</p><p>Using development machines without setting up virtual environments will probably leave you with false assumptions and results. Once you deploy the application to another machine, you could potentially run into new problems.</p><p>Typically CI server uses a version control system like Subversion or Git or any other to pull your project files. It monitors your project’s repository and on the successful commit, it pulls the changes and performs the tasks you defined previously for that project. Upon completion of the tasks, CI server sends feedback to the relevant project members with the details of the build. <strong>Checking out the latest version of your project, running the build scripts, running the tests, and sending notifications</strong> are the most basic functionalities of the CI servers.</p><p>Besides these, features like code analysis, code coverage, code quality reports, agent pooling, pipelines, build comparisons, IDE integration, third-party tools support and many others make the CI servers very flexible and comfortable to use.</p><hr><h2 id="everyone-is-responsible" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#everyone-is-responsible"><span>Everyone is responsible</span></a></h2><p>Even more important than hardware or software requirements is the ability of the team to take the responsible approach to the implementation of the CI. In order to use CI effectively, developers must change their day-to-day software development habits. These habits are good software development practices that you should apply even without a continuous integration system in place.</p><p>There are six practices that help individuals and teams running CI on a project:</p><ul><li><strong>Commit code frequently</strong></li><li><strong>Don’t commit broken code</strong></li><li><strong>Write unit tests</strong></li><li><strong>Fix broken builds immediately</strong></li><li><strong>All tests must pass</strong></li><li><strong>Avoid breaking code</strong></li></ul><p>That means you should not be checking in the latest changes just before lunchtime or just before you head home. You should wait for the build report to be sure the build is successful, and if it is not you should be the one fixing it.</p><p>On the other hand, you should always be on the lookout for broken builds, even if it wasn’t your fault because checking out the broken build or checking in over it can prolong the fixing process.</p><hr><h2 id="continuous-delivery-and-continuous-deployment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#continuous-delivery-and-continuous-deployment"><span>Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment</span></a></h2><p>Typical CI lifecycle consists of building the project, unit testing, deploying to the stage, and acceptance testing. Once the project successfully passes all of these stages, it is ready for deployment to the production environment.</p><p>Delivering a project to the production environment can be done automatically like the rest of the stages. But due to business concerns, it might be more suitable to do it manually.
