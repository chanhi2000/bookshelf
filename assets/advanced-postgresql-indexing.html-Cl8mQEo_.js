Postgres just scanned the whole table, grabbing our publisher along the way, and then sorted the results to get the top 10. We’ll discuss why a little later, as we did in the prior post, but the short of it is that the <strong>random</strong> heap accesses from reading so many entries off of an index would be expensive; Postgres decided the scan would be cheaper. These decisions are all about tradeoffs and are governed by statistics and cost estimates.</p><p>Previously, we threw the “other” field into the <code>INCLUDE()</code> list, so the engine wouldn’t have to leave the index to get the other field it needed. In this case, we’re selecting <em>everything</em>. I said previously to be diligent in avoiding unnecessary columns in the <code>SELECT</code> clause for just this reason, but here, we assume we actually do need all these columns.</p><p>We probably don’t want to dump every single column into the <code>INCLUDE</code> list of the index: we’d basically just be redefining our table into an index.</p><p>But why do we need to read so many rows in the first place? We have a limit of 10 on our query. The problem, of course, is that we’re ordering on title. And Postgres needs to see all rows for a publisher (2 million rows in this case) in order to sort them, and grab the first 10.

The reason is that we replaced discrete CTEs, each of which produced separate, identically sorted outputs, which the planner could identify, and apply a Merge Append to. Merge Append works on multiple, independently sorted streams of data. Instead, this is just a regular join, which produces one stream of data, and therefore needs to be sorted.</p><p>But this is no tragedy. The query runs in a tiny fraction of a <strong>milli</strong>second, and will not suffer planning time degradation like the previous CTE version would, as we add more and more publisher ids. Plus, the sort is over just <code>N*10</code> records, where N is the number of publishers. It would take a catastrophically large N to wind up with enough rows where Postgres would struggle to sort them quickly, especially since the limit of 10 would allow it to do an efficient top-N heapsort, like we saw in part 1. ---</p><h2 id="stepping-back" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stepping-back"><span>Stepping back</span></a></h2><p>The hardest part of writing this post is knowing when to stop. I could easily write as much content again: we haven’t even gotten into joins, and how indexes can help there, or even materialized views. This is an endless topic, and one that I enjoy, but we’ll stop here for now.</p><p>The one theme throughout can be summed up as: understand <em>how</em> your data is stored, and <em>craft</em> your queries to make the best use possible of this knowledge. If you’re not sure exactly how to craft your queries to do this, then use your knowledge of how indexes work, and what you want your queries to accomplish to ask an <em>extremely</em> specific question to your favorite AI model. It’s very likely to <em>at least</em> get you closer to your answer. Oftentimes knowing <em>what</em> to ask is half the battle.</p><p>And of course, if your data is not stored as you need, then change how your data is stored. Indexes are the most common way, which we’ve discussed here. Materialized views would be the next power tool to consider when needed.
