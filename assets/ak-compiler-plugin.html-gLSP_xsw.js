Like many programs, the Kotlin Compiler can use plugins that change its behavior. We define a Kotlin Compiler plugin by extending a special class, called an extension, and then register it using a registrar. Each extension is called by the compiler in a certain phase of its work, thereby potentially changing the result of this phase. For example, you can register a plugin that will be called when the compiler generates supertypes for a class, thus adding additional supertypes to the result. When we write a compiler plugin, we are limited to what the supported extensions allow us to do. We will discuss the currently available extensions soon, but let&#39;s start with some essential knowledge about how the compiler works.</p><hr><h2 id="compiler-frontend-and-backend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#compiler-frontend-and-backend"><span>Compiler frontend and backend</span></a></h2><p>Kotlin is a multiplatform language, which means the same code can be used to generate low-level code for different platforms.

All the frontend extensions start with the <code>Fir</code> prefix and end with the <code>Extension</code> suffix. Here is the complete list of the currently supported K2 extensions<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup></p><ul><li><code>FirStatusTransformerExtension</code> - called when an element status (visibility, modifiers, etc.) is established and allows it to be changed. The All-open compiler plugin uses it to make all classes with appropriate annotations open by default (e.g., used by Spring Framework).</li><li><code>FirDeclarationGenerationExtension</code> - can specify additional declarations to be generated for a Kotlin file. Its different methods are called at different phases of compilation and allow the generation of different kinds of elements, like classes or methods. Used by many plugins, including the Kotlin Serialization plugin, to generate serialization methods.</li><li><code>FirAdditionalCheckersExtension</code> - allows the specification of additional checkers that will be called when the compiler checks the code; it can also report additional errors or warnings that can be visualized by IntelliJ.</li><li><code>FirSupertypeGenerationExtension</code> - called when the compiler generates supertypes for a class and allows additional supertypes to be added. For instance, if the class <code>A</code> inherits from <code>B</code> and implements <code>C</code>, and the extension decides it should also have supertypes <code>D</code> and <code>F</code>, then the compiler will consider <code>A</code> to have supertypes <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>F</code>. Used by many plugins, including the Kotlin Serialization plugin, which uses it to make all classes annotated with the <code>Serializer</code> annotation have an implicit <code>KSerializer</code> supertype with appropriate type arguments.</li><li><code>FirTypeAttributeExtension</code> - allows an attribute to be added to a type based on an annotation or determines an annotation based on an attribute. Used by the experimental Kotlin Assignment plugin, which allows a number type to be annotated as either positive or negative and then uses this information to throw an error if this contract is broken. Works with the code of libraries used by our project.</li><li><code>FirExpressionResolutionExtension</code> - can be used to add an implicit extension receiver when a function is called. Used by the experimental Kotlin Assignment plugin, which injects <code>Algebra&lt;T&gt;</code> as an implicit receiver if <code>injectAlgebra&lt;T&gt;()</code> is called.</li><li><code>FirSamConversionTransformerExtension</code> - called when the compiler converts a Java SAM interface to a Kotlin function type and allows the result type to be changed. Used by the <code>SAM-with-receiver compiler plugin</code> to generate a function type with a receiver instead of a regular function type for SAM interfaces with appropriate annotation.</li><li><code>FirAssignExpressionAltererExtension</code> - allows a variable assignment to be transformed into any kind of statement. Used by the experimental Kotlin Assignment plugin, which allows the assignment operator to be overloaded.</li><li><code>FirFunctionTypeKindExtension</code> - allows additional function types to be registered. Works with the code of libraries used by our project.</li><li><code>FirDeclarationsForMetadataProviderExtension</code> - currently allows additional declarations to be added in Kotlin metadata. Used by the Kotlin Serialization plugin to generate a deserialization constructor or a method to write itself. Its behavior might change in the future.</li><li><code>FirScriptConfiguratorExtension</code> - currently called when the compiler processes a script; it also allows the script configuration to be changed. Its behavior might change in the future.</li><li><code>FirExtensionSessionComponent</code> - currently allows additional extension session components to be added for a session. In other words, it allows a component to be registered so that it can be reused by different extensions. Used by many plugins. For instance, the Kotlin Serialization plugin uses it to register a component that keeps a cache of serializers in a file or KClass first from file annotation. Its behavior might change in the future.</li></ul><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">Note</p><p>Beware! In this chapter we only discuss K2 frontend extensions because the K1 frontend is deprecated and will be removed in the future. However, the K2 compiler frontend is currently not used by default.

They can be used to show a warning or break compilation with an error. They can also be used to change the visibility of specific elements, thus influencing the behavior of the resulting code and suggestions in IDE.</p><p>Regarding the backend, there is only one extension: <code>IrGenerationExtension</code>. It is used after IR (Kotlin intermediate representation) is generated from the FIR (frontend intermediate representation) but before it is used to generate platform-specific files. <code>IrGenerationExtension</code> is used to modify the IR tree. This means that <code>IrGenerationExtension</code> can change absolutely anything in the generated code, but using it is hard as we can easily introduce breaking changes, so it must be used with great care. Also, <code>IrGenerationExtension</code> cannot influence code analysis, so it cannot impact IDE suggestions, warnings, etc.</p><figure><img src="https://kt.academy/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcinmoskala.com%2Fadvanced-kotlin-book%2Fmanuscript%2Fresources%2Fbackend_plugin_place.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75" alt="Backend plugin extensions are used after IR (Kotlin Intermediate Representation) is generated from the FIR (frontend intermediate representation), but before it is used to generate platform-specific files." tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Backend plugin extensions are used after IR (Kotlin Intermediate Representation) is generated from the FIR (frontend intermediate representation), but before it is used to generate platform-specific files.</figcaption></figure><p>I want to make it clear that the backend cannot influence IDE analysis. If you use <code>IrGenerationExtension</code> to add a method to a class, you won’t be able to call it directly in IntelliJ because it won’t recognize such a method, so you will only be able to call it using reflection. In contrast, a method added to a class using the frontend <code>FirDeclarationGenerationExtension</code> can be used directly because the IDE knows about its existence.</p><p>The majority of popular Kotlin plugins require multiple extensions, both frontend and backend. For instance, Kotlin Serialization uses backend extensions to generate all the functions for serialization and deserialization; on the other hand, it uses frontend extensions to add implicit supertypes, checks and declarations.</p><p>This is the essential knowledge about Kotlin Compiler plugins.

In our case, we determine whether the function should be transformed; if so, we create a function type with a receiver by using the <code>createFunctionType</code> function. There are builder functions that help us to create many elements that are represented in FIR. Examples include <code>buildSimpleFunction</code> or <code>buildRegularClass</code>, and most of them offer a simple DSL. Here, the <code>createFunctionType</code> function creates a function type with a receiver representation of type <code>ConeLookupTagBasedType</code>, which will replace automatically generated types from a SAM interface. In essence, this is how this plugin works.</p><hr><h2 id="generate-function-wrappers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generate-function-wrappers"><span>Generate function wrappers</span></a></h2><p>Let&#39;s consider the following problem: Kotlin suspend functions can only be called in Kotlin code. This means that if you want to call a suspend function from Java, you can use, for example, <code>runBlocking</code> to wrap it in a regular function that calls the suspend function in a coroutine.</p><div class="language-kotlin line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="kt"><pre><code class="language-kotlin"><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">suspend</span> <span class="token keyword">fun</span> <span class="token function">suspendFunction</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token comment">/* ... */</span></span>

These wrapper functions will be present in the generated platform-specific code and are therefore available for Java, Groovy, and other languages. The problem is that these wrapper classes will not be visible in Kotlin code. This is fine if our wrapper functions are meant to be used from other languages anyway, but we need to know about this serious limitation. There is an open-source plugin called kotlin-jvm-blocking-bridge that generates blocking wrappers for suspend functions using a backend plugin; you can find its source code under the link <code>github.com/Him188/kotlin-jvm-blocking-bridge</code>.</p><p>A frontend plugin would require an extension for the class <code>FirDeclarationGenerationExtension</code> to generate wrapper functions for the appropriate suspend functions in FIR. These additional functions would then be used to generate IR and finally platform-specific code. Those functions would also be visible in IntelliJ, so we would be able to use them in both Kotlin and Java. However, such a plugin would only work with the K2 compiler, so since Kotlin 2.0. To support the previous language version, we need to define an additional extension that supports K1. ---</p><h2 id="example-plugin-implementations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#example-plugin-implementations"><span>Example plugin implementations</span></a></h2><p>Kotlin Compiler Plugins are currently not documented, and generated elements must respect many restrictions for our code to not break, so defining custom plugins is quite hard. If you want to define your own plugin, my recommendation is to first get the Kotlin Compiler sources and then analyze the existing plugins in the <code>plugins</code> folder.</p><figure><img src="https://kt.academy/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcinmoskala.com%2Fadvanced-kotlin-book%2Fmanuscript%2Fresources%2Fplugins_folder.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This folder includes not only K2 plugins but also K1 and KSP-based plugins. We are only interested in K2 plugins, so you can ignore the rest.</p><p>A list of all the supported extensions can be found in the <code>FirExtensionRegistrar</code> class. To analyze how the compiler uses an extension, you can search for the usage of its open methods. To do this, hit command/Ctrl and click on a method name to jump to its usage. This should show you where the Kotlin Compiler uses this extension. Beware, though, that all the knowledge that is not documented is more likely to change in the future.</p><hr><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#summary"><span>Summary</span></a></h2><p>As you can see, the capabilities of Kotlin Compiler Plugins are determined by the extensions supported by the Kotlin Compiler. On the compiler’s frontend, these extension capabilities are limited, so there is currently only a specific set of things that can be done on the frontend with Kotlin Compiler Plugins. On the compiler backend, you can change generated IR representation in any way; this offers many possibilities but can also easily cause breaking changes in your code.</p><p>Kotlin Compiler Plugins technology is still young, undocumented, and changing. It should be used with great care as it can easily break your code, but it is also extremely powerful and offers possibilities beyond comprehension. Jetpack Compose is a great example. I have only been able to share with you the general idea of how Kotlin Compiler Plugins work and what they can do, but I hope it is enough for you to understand the key concept and possibilities.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will talk about another tool that helps with code development: static code analyzers. On the one hand, it is more limited than KSP or Compiler Plugins because it cannot generate any code; on the other hand, static code analyzers are also extremely powerful as they can seriously influence our development process and help us improve our actual code.</p>`,26)),p(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),s(c,d(u({title:"Kotlin Compiler Plugins",desc:"All you need to know about Kotlin Compiler plugins.",link:"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/kt.academy/ak-compiler-plugin.html",logo:"https://kt.academy/logo.png",background:"rgba(243,139,49,0.2)"})),null,16),n[37]||(n[37]=r('<hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="footnote1" class="footnote-item"><p>K1 extensions are deprecated, so I will just skip them. <a href="#footnote-ref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>',2))])}const z=b(x,[["render",S]]),j=JSON.parse('{"path":"/kt.academy/ak-compiler-plugin.html","title":"Kotlin Compiler Plugins","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Kotlin Compiler Plugins","description":"Article(s) > Kotlin Compiler Plugins","icon":"iconfont icon-kotlin","category":["Java","Kotlin","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","kt.academy","java","kotlin"],"head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Kotlin Compiler Plugins\\",\\"image\\":[\\"https://kt.academy/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcinmoskala.com%2Fadvanced-kotlin-book%2Fmanuscript%2Fresources%2Fcompiler_frontend_backend.png&w=1080&q=75\\",\\"https://kt.academy/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcinmoskala.com%2Fadvanced-kotlin-book%2Fmanuscript%2Fresources%2Fcompiler_bckend_ir.png&w=1080&q=75\\",\\"https://kt.academy/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcinmoskala.com%2Fadvanced-kotlin-book%2Fmanuscript%2Fresources%2Fbackend_plugin_place.png&w=1080&q=75\\",\\"https://kt.academy/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarcinmoskala.com%2Fadvanced-kotlin-book%2Fmanuscript%2Fresources%2Fplugins_folder.png&w=1080&q=75\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Marcin Moskała\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://kt.academy/user/marcinmoskala\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/kt.academy/ak-compiler-plugin.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"📚Bookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Kotlin Compiler Plugins"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Kotlin Compiler Plugins"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://marcinmoskala.com/advanced-kotlin-book/promotion/12_compiler_plugin.jpg"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:src","content":"https://marcinmoskala.com/advanced-kotlin-book/promotion/12_compiler_plugin.jpg"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:alt","content":"Kotlin Compiler Plugins"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Marcin Moskała"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"kotlin"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"java"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"kt.academy"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z"}],[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Kotlin Compiler Plugins"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Kotlin Compiler Plugins"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/kt.academy/ak-compiler-plugin.html"}]],"prev":"/programming/java/articles/README.md","date":"2025-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false,"author":[{"name":"Marcin Moskała","url":"https://kt.academy/user/marcinmoskala"}],"cover":"https://marcinmoskala.com/advanced-kotlin-book/promotion/12_compiler_plugin.jpg"},"git":{},"readingTime":{"minutes":11.23,"words":3369},"filePathRelative":"kt.academy/ak-compiler-plugin.md","copyright":{"author":"Marcin Moskała"}}');export{z as comp,j as data};
