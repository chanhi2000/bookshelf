The problem is that in the preceding three steps, the experience is either completely broken or unusable. A car is useless with just one wheel or with no windows or roof (especially in rain-sodden England where I am based). It’s only when everything works perfectly when this experience is optimal, which in the case of the web, knowing that the likelihood that everything will work perfect is <em>extremely low</em>, seems like a suboptimal approach.</p><p>Step in the second row, which has the same four steps. The difference here is instead of a single wheel: step 1 is a skateboard. Instead of a chassis and wheels only, step 2 is a micro scooter. Step 3 is a push bike, instead of a car with no roof or windows, and finally, step 4 is a motor scooter instead of a car. Every step is acceptable and gets the user from A to B. It just so happens that with each <em>progression</em>, the experience gets better.</p><p>I deliberately chose the motor scooter as the optimal experience in this illustration because if you work with a progressive enhanced mindset — creating a minimum viable experience — you more often-than-not, create a much lighter end-product. This is because you don’t need to mess around with backwards-compatibility hacks or polyfills.</p><hr><h2 id="identifying-a-minimum-viable-experience" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#identifying-a-minimum-viable-experience"><span>Identifying a minimum viable experience</span></a></h2>',7)),t("p",null,[e[21]||(e[21]=i("I’ll quickly run-down the process of how I identify a minimum viable experience and then, enhance it.
