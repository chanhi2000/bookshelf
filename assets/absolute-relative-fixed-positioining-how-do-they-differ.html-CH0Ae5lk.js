Literally a rectangle of pixels. This is easy to understand when you set the element to <code>display: block;</code> or if that element is block-level by default like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This means you can set a <code>width</code> and a <code>height</code> and that element will respect that. But elements that are <code>display: inline;</code>, like a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> by default, are <em>also</em> rectangles, they just flow onto the page differently, lining up horizontally as they can.</p><p>Now that you are picturing every single page element as a block of pixels, we can talk about how positioning is used to get the blocks of pixels exactly where you want them to go.</p><div class="language-css line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="css"><pre><code class="language-css"><span class="line"><span class="token selector">.el</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

Different elements don’t have different default values for positioning, they all start out as <code>static</code>. Static doesn’t mean much; it just means that the element will flow into the page as it normally would. The only reason you would ever set an element to <code>position: static;</code> is to forcefully remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control. This is fairly rare, as positioning doesn’t cascade.</p><h3 id="relative" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#relative"><span><code>relative</code></span></a></h3><p>This type of positioning is probably the most confusing and misused. What it really means is “relative to itself”. If you set <code>position: relative;</code> on an element but no other positioning attributes (<code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code> or <code>right</code>), it will have no effect on it’s positioning at all, it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as <code>position: static;</code> But if you <em>do</em> give it some other positioning attribute, say, <code>top: 10px;</code>, it will shift its position 10 pixels <em>down</em> from where it would <em>normally</em> be. I’m sure you can imagine, the ability to shift an element around based on its regular position is pretty useful. I find myself using this to line up form elements many times that have a tendency to not want to line up how I want them to.</p><p>There are two other things that happen when you set <code>position: relative;</code> on an element that you should be aware of. One is that it introduces the ability to use <code>z-index</code> on that element, which doesn’t work with statically positioned elements. Even if you don’t set a <code>z-index</code> value, this element will now appear <strong>on top</strong> of any other statically positioned element. You can’t fight it by setting a higher <code>z-index</code> value on a statically positioned element.</p>`,14)),t("p",null,[e[14]||(e[14]=o("The other thing that happens is it ")),e[15]||(e[15]=t("strong",null,"limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements",-1)),e[16]||(e[16]=o(".

You use the positioning attributes <code>top</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>right</code> to set the location. Remember that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element itself meaning it will be placed relative to the page itself.</p><p>The trade-off (and most important thing to remember) about absolute positioning is that these elements are <strong>removed from the flow</strong> of elements on the page. An element with this type of positioning is not affected by other elements and it doesn’t affect other elements. This is a serious thing to consider every time you use absolute positioning. Its overuse or improper use can limit the flexibility of your site.</p><h3 id="fixed" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fixed"><span><code>fixed</code></span></a></h3><p>A <code>fixed</code> position element is positioned relative to the <em>viewport</em>, or the browser window itself.
