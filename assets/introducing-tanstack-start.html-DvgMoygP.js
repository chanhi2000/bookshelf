With this type of app, the server sends down a mostly empty HTML page, possibly with some sort of splash image, loading spinner, or maybe some navigation components. It also includes, very importantly, script tags that load your framework of choice (React, Vue, Svelte, etc) and a bundle of your application code.</p><p>These apps were always fun to build, and in spite of the hate they often get, they (usually) worked just fine (any kind of software can be bad). Admittedly, they suffer a big disadvantage: initial render performance. Remember, the initial render of the page was just an empty shell of your app. This displayed while your script files loaded and executed, and once<em>those</em>scripts were run, your application code would most likely need to request data before your actual app could display. Under the covers, your app is doing something like this</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/csr-perf-flow.png?resize=772%2C874&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The initial render of the page, from the web server, renders only an empty shell of your application. Then some scripts are requested, and then parsed and executed. When those application scripts run, you (likely) send some other requests for data. Once<em>that</em>is done, your page displays.</p><p>To put it more succinctly, with client-rendered web apps, when the user first loads your app, they’ll just get a loading spinner. Maybe your company’s logo above it, if they’re lucky.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/csr-user.png?resize=684%2C498&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is perhaps an overstatement. Users may not even notice the delay caused by these scripts loading (which are likely cached), or hydration, which is probably fast. Depending on the speed of their network, and the type of application, this stuff might not matter much.</p><p><em>Maybe.</em></p><p>But if our tools now make it easy to do better, why not do better?</p><h3 id="server-side-rendering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#server-side-rendering"><span>Server Side Rendering</span></a></h3><p>With SSR, the picture looks more like this</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ssr-render.png?resize=788%2C884&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The server sends down the complete, finished page that the user can see immediately.

If our data was slow to load, our server would be slow to respond. It’s bad for the user to be stuck looking at a loading spinner, but it’s even worse for the user to be stuck looking at a blank screen while the server churns.</p><p>As a solution for this, we can use something called “streaming,” or “out of order streaming” to be more precise. The user still requests all the data, as before, but we tell our server “don’t wait for this/these data, which are slow: render everything else, now, and send that slow data to the browser when it’s ready.”</p><p>All modern meta-frameworks support this, and our picture now looks like this</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ssr-streaming-user.png?resize=822%2C500&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>To put a finer point on it, the server does still initiate the request for our slow data<em>immediately</em>, on the server during our initial navigation.

They were, and frankly<em>still are</em>an incredible way to ship deeply interactive user experiences with JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue. The fact of the matter is, server rendering a web app built with React was tricky to get right. You not only needed to server render and send down the HTML for the page the user requested, but also send down the<em>data</em>for that page, and hydrate everything<em>just right</em>on the client.</p><p>It’s hard to get right. But here’s the thing:<strong>getting this right is the one of the primary purposes of this new generation of meta-frameworks</strong>. Next, Nuxt, Remix, SvelteKit, and SolidStart are some of the more famous examples of these meta-frameworks. And now TanStack Start.</p><hr><h2 id="why-is-tanstack-start-different" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-tanstack-start-different"><span>Why is TanStack Start different?</span></a></h2><p>Why do we need a new meta-framework? There’s many possible answers to that question, but I’ll give mine. Existing meta-frameworks suffer from some variation on the same issue. They’ll provide some mechanism to load data on the server. This mechanism is often called a “loader,” or in the case of Next, it’s just RSCs (React Server Components). In Next’s (older) pages directory, it’s the<code>getServerSideProps</code>function. The specifics don’t matter. What matters is, for each route, whether the initial load of the page, or client-side navigation via links, some server-side code will run, send down the data, and then render the new page.</p><h3 id="an-impedance-mismatch-is-born" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#an-impedance-mismatch-is-born"><span>An Impedance Mismatch is Born</span></a></h3><p>Notice the two worlds that exist: the server, where data loading code will always run, and the client. It’s the difference and separation between these worlds that can cause issues.</p><p>For example, frameworks always provide some mechanism to mutate data, and then re-fetch to show updated state. Imagine your loader for a page loads some tasks, user settings, and announcements. When the user edits a task, and revalidates, these frameworks will almost always re-run the entire loader, and superfluously re-load the user’s announcements and user settings, in addition to tasks, even though tasks are the only thing that changed.</p><p>Are there fixes? Of course. Many frameworks will allow you to create extra loaders to spread the data loading across, and revalidate only<em>some</em>of them. Other frameworks encourage you to cache your data. These solutions all work, but come with their own tradeoffs. And remember, they’re solutions to a problem that meta-frameworks <em>created</em>, by having server-side loading code for every path in your app.</p><p>Or what about a loader that loads 5 different pieces of data? After the page loads, the user starts browsing around, occasionally coming back to that first page. These frameworks will usually cache that previously-displayed page, for a time. Or not. But it’s all or none. When the loader re-runs, all 5 pieces of data will re-fire, even if 4 of them can be cached safely.</p><p>You might think using a component-level data loading solution like react-query can help. react-query is great, but it doesn’t eliminate these problems. If you have two different pages that each have 5 data sources, of which 4 are shared in common, browsing from the first page to the second will cause the second page to re-request all 5 pieces of data, even though 4 of them are already present in client-side state from the first page. The server is unaware of what happens to exist on the client. The server is not keeping track of what state you have in your browser; in fact the “server” might just be a Lambda function that spins up, satisfies your request, and then dies off.</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/extra-data.png?resize=724%2C800&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In the picture, we can see a loader from the server sending down data for <code>queryB</code>, which we already have in our TanStack cache.</p><h3 id="where-to-from-here" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-from-here"><span>Where to, from here?</span></a></h3><p>The root problem is that these meta-frameworks inevitably have server-only code running on each path, integrating with long-running client-side state. This leads to conflicts and inefficiencies which need to be managed. There’s ways of handling these things, which I touched on above. But it’s not a completely clean fit.</p><h3 id="how-much-does-it-matter" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-much-does-it-matter"><span>How much does it matter?</span></a></h3><p>Let’s be clear right away: if this situation is killing performance of your site, you have bigger problems.

The more of these calls we’re firing off, the better the chances that some of them might randomly be slow for some reason beyond our control. Or fail.</p><p>We typically tolerate requesting more than we need in these scenarios because it’s hard to avoid with our current tooling.
