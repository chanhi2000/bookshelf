Log downloading programs connect to a query socket (labelled “memlogdq.sock”), read logs from the internal buffer and write them somewhere else.</p><p>Recall that one of our design goals was to avoid making changes to each individual container definition to use the new logging system. We don’t want to explicitly bind-mount a logging socket into the container or have to modify the container’s code to connect to it. How then do we capture the output from containers automatically and pass it all to the linuxkit-external-logging.sock?</p><p>When an on-boot action or service is launched, the VM’s init system creates a FIFO (for containerd) or a socketpair (for runc) for the stdout and stderr. By convention LinuxKit containers normally write their log entries to stderr. Therefore if we modify the init system, we can capture the logs written to the stderr FIFOs and the socketpairs without having to change the container definition or the code. Once the logs have been captured, the next step is to send them to memlogd — how do we do that?</p><p>A little known feature of Linux is that you can pass open file descriptors to other processes via Unix domain sockets. We can, instead of proxying log lines, just pass an open socket directly to memlogd. We modified the design for memlogd to take advantage of this:</p><figure><img src="https://docker.com/app/uploads/2020/01/blog-img-3.png" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When the container is started, the init system passes the stdout and stderr file descriptors to memlogd along with the name of the container. Memlogd monitors all its file descriptors in a select-loop. When data is available it will be read, tagged with the container name and timestamped before it is appended to the in-memory ringbuffer. When the container terminates, the fd is closed and memlogd removes the fd from the loop.</p><p>So this means:</p><ul><li>we don’t have to modify container YAML definitions or code to be aware of the logging system; and</li><li>we don’t have to proxy logs between the container and memlogd.</li></ul><h3 id="querying-memlogd" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#querying-memlogd"><span>Querying memlogd</span></a></h3><p>To see memlogd in action on a Docker Desktop system, try the following command:</p><div class="language-bash line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="sh"><pre><code class="language-bash"><span class="line"><span class="token function">docker</span> run <span class="token parameter variable">-it</span> <span class="token parameter variable">--privileged</span> <span class="token parameter variable">--pid</span><span class="token operator">=</span>host <span class="token punctuation">\\</span></span>
