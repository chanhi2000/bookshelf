A true beginner with no web design experience at all might watch all the underlines on the links on their page disappear with a single CSS statement and be hooked. A seasoned veteran of web design coming from an environment where they were responsible for layout changes in complicated table-based systems might marvel at the ease of a CSS based structure and be hooked.</p><p>More likely though, it is something much smaller which causes the spark.
