And indeed, they all seem to do the same thing: two equal width columns.

For instance, if we apply some <code>gap</code> between the columns. Here’s the examples with <code>16px</code> of <code>gap</code> applied:</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.29.11 AM.png?resize=1024%2C754&amp;ssl=1" alt="Screenshot showing three grid layouts side by side: the first has two equal width columns labeled &#39;50% 50%&#39;, the second uses &#39;auto auto&#39;, and the third shows &#39;1fr 1fr&#39;.

Sometimes we think of % units as being quite flexible, but here we’re rather forcefully saying each columns needs to be 50% as wide as it’s parent element, so the width of the whole grid is actually <code>50% + 16px + 50%</code> which is <em>wider than 100%.</em></p><p>This is pretty awkward and largely why you don’t see columns set up using % values all that much. But it still can be valuable! The “sturdiness” of setting a column that way can be desirable, as we’ll see. If we wanted to prevent the “blowout”, we could account for the gap ourselves.</p><div class="language-css line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="css"><pre><code class="language-css"><span class="line"><span class="token selector">.grid</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span>

A way to think about it is that, however you’ve sized a column, the minimum width of that column is essentially <code>auto</code>, and that can prevent it from staying sized how you want it to when there is content that pushes it wider. For instance, putting a long URL (no dashes and no spaces in a URL means it can’t “break” or wrap naturally).</p><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/frontendmasters.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-11-at-4.56.49 AM.png?resize=1024%2C603&amp;ssl=1" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>You can see the columns blowing out in the <code>auto</code> and <code>1fr</code> columns above.
