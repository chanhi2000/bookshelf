Here&#39;s a small framework to help you decide.</p><p><strong>Orchestration</strong> excels when:</p><ul><li>You need to wait for the completion of intermediate steps (such as credit card payment confirmation)</li><li>You need to make a conditional choice of subsequent steps</li><li>The process must be carried out atomically (entirely or not at all)</li><li>The process needs to be centralized in one place for monitoring</li></ul><p>This also means you will need a central database managed by the orchestrator to handle all workflow-related state.</p><p><strong>Choreography</strong> works best when:</p><ul><li>The process can rely on the input message without needing additional context</li><li>Steps clearly follow one another</li><li>Progress is made in one direction</li></ul><p>You can benefit from increased flexibility (such as modifying individual steps in isolation) Unfortunately, choreography can make it difficult to trace, debug, or monitor the processes triggered by an event. And the larger the event stream is, the more challenging it becomes.</p><p>So, think carefully before opting for orchestration or choreography.</p><p>Both approaches bring their advantages but also downsides.</p><hr><h2 id="takeaway" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#takeaway"><span>Takeaway</span></a></h2><p><strong>Orchestration</strong> defines a sequence of steps that each microservice must follow. This is great for identifying and addressing complex service interdependencies. Another benefit is that business logic can be managed and monitored in one place.</p><p><strong>Choreography</strong>, on the other hand, is a decentralized technique for microservices communication. Each service can operate independently while still being part of the larger architecture.</p><p>To decide which approach to use, you should observe your system and identify what you stand to gain or lose. Everything is a tradeoff.</p><p>There&#39;s also an <strong>alternative approach</strong> I want to mention.</p><p>You could go for a <strong>hybrid approach</strong> that integrates orchestration and choreography.</p><p>In a <strong>hybrid approach</strong>, you decide which communication technique to use for a specific workflow. Some workflows can benefit from orchestration, and others can benefit more from choreography.</p><p>Hope this was helpful.</p><p>I&#39;ll see you next week!</p>',30))])}const j=d(w,[["render",T]]),A=JSON.parse('{"path":"/milanjovanovic.tech/orchestration-vs-choreography.html","title":"Orchestration vs Choreography","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Orchestration vs Choreography","description":"Article(s) > Orchestration vs Choreography","icon":"fas fa-pen-ruler","category":["Design","System","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","milanjovanovic.tech","system","design"],"head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Orchestration vs Choreography\\",\\"image\\":[\\"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_052/microservices_hell.png?imwidth=1920\\",\\"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_052/orchestration.png?imwidth=2048\\",\\"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_052/choreography.png?imwidth=2048\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-08-26T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Milan Jovanović\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/milanjovanovic.tech/orchestration-vs-choreography.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"📚Bookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Orchestration vs Choreography"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Orchestration vs Choreography"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog-covers/mnw_052.png"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:src","content":"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog-covers/mnw_052.png"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:alt","content":"Orchestration vs Choreography"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Milan Jovanović"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"design"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"system"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"milanjovanovic.tech"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-08-26T00:00:00.000Z"}],[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Orchestration vs Choreography"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Orchestration vs Choreography"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/milanjovanovic.tech/orchestration-vs-choreography.html"}]],"prev":"/academics/system-design/articles/README.md","date":"2023-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false,"author":"Milan Jovanović","cover":"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog-covers/mnw_052.png"},"git":{},"readingTime":{"minutes":3.72,"words":1116},"filePathRelative":"milanjovanovic.tech/orchestration-vs-choreography.md","copyright":{"author":"Milan Jovanović"}}');export{j as comp,A as data};
