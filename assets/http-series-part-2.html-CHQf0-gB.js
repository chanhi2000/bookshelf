Why don’t we just communicate directly between Web clients and Web servers? Isn’t that much simpler and faster?</p><p>Well, simple it may be, but faster, not really. But we will come to that.</p><p>Before explaining what proxy servers are, we need to get one thing out of the way. That is the concept of <strong>reverse proxy</strong> or the difference between the <strong>forward proxy</strong> and <strong>reverse proxy.</strong></p><p>The forward proxy acts as a proxy for the client requesting the resource from a Web server. It protects the client by filtering requests through the firewall or hiding the information about the client. The reverse proxy, on the other hand, works exactly the opposite way. It is usually placed behind the firewall and protects the Web servers. For all the clients know, they talk to the real Web server and remain unaware of the network behind the reverse proxy.</p><figure><img src="'+T+'" alt="Proxy server" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Proxy server</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="'+x+'" alt="Reverse proxy server" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Reverse proxy server</figcaption></figure><p>Proxies are very useful and their application is pretty wide. Let’s go through some of the ways you can use proxy servers.</p><ul><li><strong>Compression</strong>: Compressing the content directly increases the communication speed. Simple as that.</li><li><strong>Monitoring and filtering</strong>: Want to deny access to adult websites to the children in the elementary school? The proxy is the right solution for you 🙂</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: Proxies can serve as a single entry point to the entire network. They can detect malicious applications and restrict application-level protocols.</li><li><strong>Anonymity</strong>: Requests can be modified by the proxy to achieve greater anonymity. It can strip the sensitive information from the request and leave just the important stuff. Although sending less information to the server might degrade the user experience, anonymity is sometimes the more important factor.</li><li><strong>Access control</strong>: Pretty straightforward, you can centralize the access control of the many servers on a single proxy server.</li><li><strong>Caching</strong>: You can use the proxy server to cache the popular content, and thus greatly reduce the loading speeds.</li><li><strong>Load balancing</strong>: If you have a service that gets a lot of “peak traffic” you can use a proxy to distribute the workload on more computing resources or Web servers. Load balancers route traffic to avoid overloading the single server when the peak happens.</li><li><strong>Transcoding</strong>: Changing the contents of the message body can also be the proxy’s responsibility</li></ul><p>As you can see, proxies can be very versatile and flexible.</p><hr><h2 id="caching" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caching"><span>Caching</span></a></h2><p>Web caches are devices that automatically make copies of the requested data and save them in the local storage.</p><p>By doing this, they can:</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce traffic flow</strong></li><li><strong>Eliminate network bottlenecks</strong></li><li><strong>Prevent server overload</strong></li><li><strong>Reduce the response delay</strong> on long distances</li></ul><p>So you can clearly say that Web caches improve both user experience and Web server performance. And of course, potentially save a lot of money.</p><p>The fraction of the requests served from the cache is called <strong>Hit Rate.</strong> It can range from 0 to 1, where 0 is 0% and 1 is 100% request served.
