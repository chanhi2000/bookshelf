Swift takes the viewpoint that errors are exceptional conditions that the program has to deal with, but <code>program bugs are not exceptional conditions.</code> When Swift detects a program bug, such as an out-of-bounds index into an array or an attempt to force an optional value containing <code>nil</code> (via <code>!</code> or <code>as!</code>), it will immediately halt the program. It will look like a program crash, but should be accompanied by a message indicating what went wrong.</p><p>The Swift philosophy, echoed by Herb&#39;s §4.2, is that a program should not attempt to recover from a programmer error. Programmer errors are likely to mean broken invariants that will cause more problems later, and a program that&#39;s limping on after a program error is ripe for security exploits. So when things go wrong, Swift halts the program to prevent further damage.</p><p>Now, you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to buy in to Swift&#39;s philosophy here. You can go ahead and add an <code>Array</code> subscript that throws when out of bounds, or a cast operation that throws when it fails, and generally turn every bad thing that can happen into a thrown error. You&#39;ll be going against the grain of the Swift standard library and general community, but it&#39;s possible. But know that I will know, and I will judge you.</p><h3 id="try-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#try-1"><span><code>try!</code></span></a></h3><p>There are some times when you&#39;re using a general operation that can throw an error, but because of where you are in the program, you <em>know</em> it can&#39;t fail. Perhaps you&#39;re working from data that&#39;s baked into the program elsewhere, or are in program startup where things can&#39;t go wrong yet. As a corollary to <code>try?</code>, there&#39;s a <code>try!</code> operation that produces a fatal error if an error is thrown from its subexpression. For example, if we do:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift"><pre><code class="language-swift"><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">let</span> value <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">try</span><span class="token operator">!</span> <span class="token class-name">Int8</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>parsing<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;1+23&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

To support this checking consistently, Swift provides the <code>precondition</code> function, which takes a <code>Bool</code> condition, an optional error message string, and optional file/line information (that will be automatically filled in for you). For example, a bounds check on an array subscript will use a precondition like this:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift"><pre><code class="language-swift"><span class="line"><span class="token function">precondition</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>index <span class="token operator">&gt;=</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> index <span class="token operator">&lt;</span> count<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string-literal"><span class="token string">&quot;out-of-bounds array index&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></span>

In essence, when we wrote the expression <code>index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt; count</code>, Swift packaged that up into a closure</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift"><pre><code class="language-swift"><span class="line"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> index <span class="token operator">&gt;=</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;&amp;</span> index <span class="token operator">&lt;</span> count <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span>

If you form a closure that calls <code>fatalError</code>, it will be inferred to have result type <code>Never</code>, so we know that calls to that closure never return. And if you call a generic function that returns a <code>T</code>, and <code>T</code> is inferred to <code>Never</code>, you know that the generic function won&#39;t return.</p><p>Let&#39;s get back to throwing. If a function isn&#39;t marked with <code>throws</code>, then it doesn&#39;t throw. One might say it... <em>never</em>... throws. Joking aside, this means that a function that <code>throws(Never)</code> is equivalent to one that does not throw. So typed throws is actually a generalization of throwing functions, where <code>throws(any Error)</code> is &quot;can throw anything&quot; and <code>throws(Never)</code> is &quot;does not throw&quot;, and you can have any <code>throws(Concrete)</code> in between.</p><h3 id="generic-error-propagation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#generic-error-propagation"><span>Generic error propagation</span></a></h3><p>A bit earlier, we had this call to <code>map</code>:</p><div class="language-swift line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="swift"><pre><code class="language-swift"><span class="line"><span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token keyword">try</span> strings<span class="token punctuation">.</span>map <span class="token punctuation">{</span> </span>

For C++ practitioners, there&#39;s a lot to be familiar with, because the basic model is effectively the same: thrown errors propagate up until they hit a matching catch. However, the defaults have been re-oriented to make exceptional conditions uncommon, static checking has been made sound to prevent accidents, and exceptional control flow has been made explicit to aid in understanding code.</p><p>And although it&#39;s not baked into the language design per se, Swift has definite opinions about when to throw errors and when to trap. Programmer errors should trap as soon as they are detected to prevent them from causing bad behavior, including security issues. Other exceptional conditions that prevent the normal flow of the problem should be reported as errors, preserving enough detail to provide a useful error message to be logged for the programmer or reported to the end user. I believe that following this philosophy, and being properly supported by the language in handling errors, leads to better-quality code in the long run.</p>`,13))])}const M=d(g,[["render",z]]),$=JSON.parse('{"path":"/douggregor.net/swift-for-cpp-practitioners-6.html","title":"Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling","description":"Article(s) > Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling","icon":"fa-brands fa-swift","category":["Swift","C++","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","douggregor.net","swift","ios","c++","cpp"],"head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2024-04-15T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/douggregor.net/swift-for-cpp-practitioners-6.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"📚Bookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"cpp"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"c++"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"ios"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"swift"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"douggregor.net"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2024-04-15T00:00:00.000Z"}],[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Swift for C++ Practitioners, Part 6: Error Handling"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/douggregor.net/swift-for-cpp-practitioners-6.html"}]],"prev":"/programming/swift/articles/README.md","date":"2024-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false},"git":{},"readingTime":{"minutes":20.97,"words":6291},"filePathRelative":"douggregor.net/swift-for-cpp-practitioners-6.md"}');export{M as comp,$ as data};
