It&#39;s easy to get swayed with the latest trends, and loose sight of architectural principles that really matter.</p><p>One of the more popular ones is <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>, a design approach that prioritizes maintainability, scalability, flexibility, and productivity.</p><p>In this week&#39;s newsletter, we will explore the key benefits of using <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> and how it can help your team build better software.</p><p>Let&#39;s dive in.</p><hr><h2 id="what-is-clean-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-clean-architecture"><span>What Is Clean Architecture?</span></a></h2><p><strong>Clean Architecture</strong>, also known as &quot;The Onion Architecture,&quot; was first introduced by Robert C. Martin (aka &quot;Uncle Bob&quot;) in his book &quot;Clean Architecture: A Craftsman&#39;s Guide to Software Structure and Design&quot;.</p><p>At its core, <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> is a way of organizing a software system in a way that separates the concerns of the various components, making it easier to understand and maintain.</p><p>In <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>, the core of the system is the <strong>&quot;inner circle&quot;</strong>, which contains the business rules and logic.</p><p>Surrounding this <strong>inner circle</strong> are layers of abstraction, each one representing a different concern.</p><figure><img src="https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_017/clean_architecture.png?imwidth=3840" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The typical outer layers are <strong>Infrastructure</strong> and <strong>Presentation</strong> layers. The <strong>Infrastructure</strong> layer handles external concerns such as APIs and databases. While the <strong>Presentation</strong> layer exposes an interface for clients to interact with the application.</p><p>The key principle of <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> is that the <strong>inner circle</strong> should not depend on the outer layers. Instead, the outer layers should depend on the <strong>inner circle</strong>. This helps to ensure that the <strong>core</strong> of the system is flexible and easy to modify, without worrying about the impact on other parts of the system.</p><hr><h2 id="benefits-of-using-clean-architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits-of-using-clean-architecture"><span>Benefits Of Using Clean Architecture</span></a></h2><p>I want to highlight some of the key benefits of using <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>.</p><h3 id="improved-maintainability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#improved-maintainability"><span>Improved Maintainability</span></a></h3><p>One of the primary benefits of using <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> is improved <strong>maintainability</strong>. By separating the concerns of the various components and enforcing the dependency rule, it becomes much easier to understand and modify the code. Depending on abstractions allows you to design your business logic in a flexible way, without having to know the implementation details.</p><h3 id="modularity-and-separation-of-concerns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#modularity-and-separation-of-concerns"><span>Modularity and Separation of Concerns</span></a></h3><p><strong>Clean Architecture</strong> helps to create a clear <strong>separation of concerns</strong> within the codebase. Each layer has a specific purpose and is decoupled from the others, making it easier to understand and modify individual components without affecting the rest of the system. This modularity also makes it easier to reuse components in other projects.</p><h3 id="testability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#testability"><span>Testability</span></a></h3><p><strong>Clean Architecture</strong> also makes it <strong>easier to test</strong> and debug the code. Because the inner circle is independent of the outer layers, it&#39;s easier to write unit tests that focus specifically on the business rules. This can help to catch errors early on in the development process and reduce the overall testing effort.</p><h3 id="loose-coupling-of-components" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#loose-coupling-of-components"><span>Loose Coupling of Components</span></a></h3><p><strong>Clean Architecture</strong> also promotes <strong>loose coupling</strong> between the various components of the system. This means that it&#39;s easier to swap out external dependencies or make other modifications without affecting the core business logic. This can be especially useful when it comes to upgrading or replacing technology.</p><h3 id="increased-flexibility" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#increased-flexibility"><span>Increased Flexibility</span></a></h3><p>Another key benefit of <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> is increased <strong>flexibility</strong>. By separating the concerns of the various components, it&#39;s easier to modify and adapt the code to changing requirements. This can be especially useful in fast-paced environments where requirements are constantly evolving.</p><h3 id="improved-team-productivity" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#improved-team-productivity"><span>Improved Team Productivity</span></a></h3><p><strong>Clean Architecture</strong> can help to improve team <strong>productivity</strong>. By establishing clear separation of responsibilities and well-defined boundaries, it&#39;s easier for team members to understand their roles and responsibilities. This can improve communication and collaboration, leading to more efficient and effective work.</p><hr><h2 id="clean-architecture-in-the-real-world" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#clean-architecture-in-the-real-world"><span>Clean Architecture In The Real World</span></a></h2><p>This all sounds nice in theory, but how does <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> perform in the real world?</p><p>I have used <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> on roughly 10 projects in the last 5 years, and I&#39;ve had a lot of success with it. It was easy to add new features, and scale the applications when necessary. <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> can easily be broken down into multiple modules or services, if performance is suffering and there is a need to scale out.</p><p>One problem with the <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> is that it is <strong>easy to overengineer</strong>.</p><p>Dogmatism is a real issue, as I see many people with strong opinions of what <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> should be. I&#39;ve been guilty of this myself in the past.</p><p>Recently, I try to be more <strong>pragmatic</strong> when using <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>. I apply what I like, and give myself the flexibility of <strong>&quot;breaking&quot;</strong> <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> if I think it will simplify things in the long run.</p><hr><h2 id="closing-thoughts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#closing-thoughts"><span>Closing Thoughts</span></a></h2><p>By following the principles of <strong>Clean Architecture</strong>, you can create a flexible and maintainable codebase that is well-suited to evolving requirements and technology.</p><p>However, it&#39;s important to be <strong>pragmatic</strong> with <strong>Clean Architecture</strong> and allow yourself to be flexible in the design, in order to simplify things in the long run.</p>',39)),t("p",null,[e[11]||(e[11]=o("If you want to see how to apply ")),e[12]||(e[12]=t("strong",null,"Clean Architecture",-1)),e[13]||(e[13]=o(" in practice, I have a ")),t("a",C,[n(h,{icon:"fa-brands fa-youtube"}),e[10]||(e[10]=t("strong",null,"playlist with more than 20 videos on Clean Architecture",-1))])])])}const T=p(b,[["render",_]]),k=JSON.parse('{"path":"/milanjovanovic.tech/clean-architecture-and-the-benefits-of-structured-software-design.html","title":"Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design","lang":"ko-KR","frontmatter":{"lang":"ko-KR","title":"Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design","description":"Article(s) > Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design","icon":"iconfont icon-csharp","category":["C#","DotNet","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","milanjovanovic.tech","cs","c#","csharp","dotnet"],"head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design\\",\\"image\\":[\\"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blogs/mnw_017/clean_architecture.png?imwidth=3840\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2022-12-24T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Milan Jovanović\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/milanjovanovic.tech/clean-architecture-and-the-benefits-of-structured-software-design.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"📚Bookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog-covers/mnw_017.png"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"ko-KR"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:src","content":"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog-covers/mnw_017.png"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:alt","content":"Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Milan Jovanović"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"dotnet"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"csharp"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"c#"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"cs"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"milanjovanovic.tech"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2022-12-24T00:00:00.000Z"}],[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Clean Architecture And The Benefits Of Structured Software Design"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/milanjovanovic.tech/clean-architecture-and-the-benefits-of-structured-software-design.html"}]],"prev":"/programming/cs/articles/README.md","date":"2022-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false,"author":"Milan Jovanović","cover":"https://milanjovanovic.tech/blog-covers/mnw_017.png"},"git":{},"readingTime":{"minutes":3.66,"words":1097},"filePathRelative":"milanjovanovic.tech/clean-architecture-and-the-benefits-of-structured-software-design.md","copyright":{"author":"Milan Jovanović"}}');export{T as comp,k as data};
