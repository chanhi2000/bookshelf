In such a case, a rollback reverts your deployment to its previous stable state.</p><p>It&#39;s important to clearly define the conditions or criteria for triggering a rollback, whether you&#39;re using software or business metrics. For instance, you could roll back a deployment if a defined failure rate goes past an acceptable threshold.</p><h3 id="have-a-deployment-strategy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#have-a-deployment-strategy"><span>Have a deployment strategy</span></a></h3><p>To ensure that you&#39;re only delivering high-quality code, it&#39;s good practice to not deploy directly to production. There are two common strategies you can implement in the pipeline: canary deployment and blue/green deployment.</p><p>In canary deployment, you deploy to a small subset of users, observe the reception, and improve as needed before deploying more widely.</p><p>In blue/green deployment, you first divert traffic to a staging (blue) environment that has received the new code changes. There, you can run tests and fix any issues without affecting the production (green) environment. Once you&#39;re ready, you can then switch the traffic back to production.</p><h3 id="prioritize-security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prioritize-security"><span>Prioritize security</span></a></h3><p>It&#39;s important to integrate security tests into your pipeline to check for and fix any vulnerabilities in your software application.

They each serve different purposes:</p><ul><li>Unit tests check individual units of code</li><li>Integration tests make sure the new changes work together with the existing codebase</li><li>End-to-end tests check the entire system from start to finish.

It&#39;s an infinite loop that starts with the initial code commit and takes you through the stages of building, testing, releasing, deploying, monitoring, and then planning new features or bug fixes for your app.</p><p>In this article, we discussed some of the best practices to consider when building a pipeline. These include making smaller changes, planning for deployment and rollbacks if necessary, monitoring your pipeline, and having a continuous feedback loop.</p><p>Since the CI/CD pipeline may include different teams within your organization, it&#39;s important to ensure everyone is involved at every stage of the development cycle to facilitate smooth collaboration.</p>',13)),v(" TODO: add ARTICLE CARD "),o(d,m(g({title:"Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps",desc:"Explore some best practices for setting up a continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline for more efficient frontend development.",link:"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend.html",logo:"/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/favicon.png",background:"rgba(112,76,182,0.2)"})),null,16)])}const O=y(A,[["render",G]]),q=JSON.parse('{"path":"/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend.html","title":"Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"lang":"en-US","title":"Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps","description":"Article(s) > Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps","icon":"iconfont icon-github-actions","category":["DevOps","Github","Github Actions","Node.js","Article(s)"],"tag":["blog","blog.logrocket.com","devops","github","github-actions","node","nodejs","node-js"],"head":[["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps\\",\\"image\\":[\\"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend/banner.png\\",\\"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend/CI-CD-pipeline-visualization.png\\",\\"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend/Get-started-GitHub-Actions.png\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":null,\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Oscar Jite-Orimiono\\",\\"url\\":\\"https://blog.logrocket.com/author/oscarjiteorimiono/\\"}]}"],["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"📚Bookshelf"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Article(s) > Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:image","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend/banner.png"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:card","content":"summary_large_image"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:src","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend/banner.png"}],["meta",{"name":"twitter:image:alt","content":"Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Oscar Jite-Orimiono"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"node-js"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"nodejs"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"node"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"github-actions"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"github"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"devops"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog.logrocket.com"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"blog"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z"}],[{"meta":null},{"property":"og:title","content":"Article(s) > Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps"},{"property":"og:description","content":"Developing an effective CI/CD pipeline for frontend apps"},{"property":"og:url","content":"https://chanhi2000.github.io/bookshelf/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend.html"}]],"prev":"/devops/github/articles/README.md","date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","isOriginal":false,"author":[{"name":"Oscar Jite-Orimiono","url":"https://blog.logrocket.com/author/oscarjiteorimiono/"}],"cover":"/assets/image/blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend/banner.png"},"git":{},"readingTime":{"minutes":7.96,"words":2387},"filePathRelative":"blog.logrocket.com/best-practices-ci-cd-pipeline-frontend.md","copyright":{"author":"Oscar Jite-Orimiono"}}');export{O as comp,q as data};
